## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Identify which regions or areas in Italy offer the best combination for a small real estate project: (a) residential or vacation property achievable for roughly €500k or less all-in (purchase + renovation or land + build), (b) strong short-term rental demand, (c) value-add or new-build potential, and (d) reasonably manageable permit and process.

**Context:** We are Canadian investors with an operator on the ground in Italy about six months a year. First deal is a pilot under €500k. We are open to buy-and-renovate or land-plus-prefab. We want to prioritize areas where STR works and where we can create value (renovation or new build), not only buy and hold.

**What we need:**
1. **Ranked shortlist** — 5–8 regions or sub-areas (e.g. "Salento", "eastern Sicily", "inland Tuscany") with a clear pros/cons for our profile. Rank by fit (best first).
2. **Rough price ranges** — for each area: typical price per m² or per unit for the type of property we'd target (e.g. small house, vacation unit). Indicate whether €500k all-in is realistic.
3. **STR demand indicators** — tourism trends, occupancy or demand data if available, seasonality (e.g. summer-only vs year-round). Which areas are "proven" vs "emerging"?
4. **Value-add / new-build** — where is it easier to renovate or build (permits, cost, contractor availability)? Any areas to avoid due to permit complexity or cost?
5. **Hidden gems or emerging areas** — any under-the-radar or up-and-coming areas that might offer better value or growth in the next few years?
6. **One-paragraph summary per area** — for each of the 5–8 areas, one short paragraph: why it fits (or doesn't), main risk, and "best for" (e.g. "best for beach STR", "best for low entry cost").

**Output format:** A report with an executive summary (top 3 recommendations), then the ranked list with the requested data. End with a comparison table: Region / All-in €500k feasible? / STR demand / Value-add ease / Main risk.

**Scope:** Italy only. Use recent data (2023–2025) where possible. Prefer sources that cite prices, regulations, or official statistics.
