# 2. Structure and stakeholders

## 1) Target legal structure (Option 1)

### 4.1 Structure

- **One Italian SPV (S.r.l.) per property**
- The SPV:
  - Holds the asset (title)
  - Contracts suppliers and construction
  - Receives income (sale or rental)
  - Pays operating costs, taxes, insurance

### 4.2 Design principles


| Principle                | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Risk isolation**       | 1 property = 1 SPV                                                 |
| **Clarity**              | Avoid “equity for materials” at outset if it complicates structure |
| **Scalability**          | Same model for Deal #2, #3                                         |
| **Strategy flexibility** | Structure works for both Flip and short-term rental                |

### Investors (Canada) — interested / probable

| Party | Role | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Thomas Lasalle** | Investor | Friend; probable main investor. In commercial real estate—strong connections in the sector. Parents have significant capital and are willing to back him if they believe the project is worth the investment. One of the most motivated participants in the deal so far. |
| **Jade Soucy** | Investor | Interested; would invest with Francis Rochon. |
| **Francis Rochon** | Investor | Boyfriend of Jade Soucy; interested in investing with her. |
| **Marianne Peter Nicol** | Investor | Interested in investing. |
| **Isaac** | Investor | Has expressed dream of buying/renovating in Italy; willing to invest significantly. Interest shared with Jade and Marianne; strong fit for this type of project. |

*Residence/tax status and form of investment (personal vs entity) to be confirmed per investor.*

**Preliminary capacity estimates (guess only; not commitments):**

| Party / group | Estimated capacity (€) | Note |
|--------------|------------------------|------|
