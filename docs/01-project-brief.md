# 1. Project brief

## 0) Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Working name** | Italy Residential SPV — Pilot Deal / Italy Home Club (Deal #1) |
| **Status** | Exploration / structuration (pre-acquisition) |
| **Objective** | Execute a first test deal (< €500k) and establish a replicable structure (portfolio) |
| **Strategies** | **Lifestyle-first asset, value-add, flexible exit** — premium STR/hybrid primary; flip as Plan B |

## 1) Executive summary

The most attractive offer for Canadian friends who “dream of Italy” is **not** “be my construction partners.” It is:

**“Own a slice of an Italian home + benefit from value creation + optional lifestyle use… without having to manage anything.”**

A group of investors (mainly in Canada) invests in Italian residential: **buy → renovate → operate as premium short-term (or hybrid) rental** → decide in 12–24 months: keep / sell / refinance. Execution is led locally by the operator (Sam), on the ground ~6 months/year in Italy, with support from local partners (e.g. doors/windows supplier and construction contacts).

**Target structure:** Option 1 — **one Italian SPV (S.r.l.) per property** (risk isolation + scalable).

## 2) Core thesis (what we are building)

**Lifestyle-first asset, value-add, flexible exit**

- **Loop:** Buy → Renovate → Operate as premium short-term rental (or hybrid) → **Decision at 12–24 months** → Keep / Sell / Refinance (if feasible) → potential Deal #2.
- **Why it sells to friends:** They get an **emotional asset** (Italy) plus a **rational plan**. Clean “what’s in it for them” without needing perfect banking assumptions on Day 1. It **de-risks uncertainty**: you don’t have to choose flip vs long-term immediately.
- **Why it fits execution:** Operator on the ground + Italy network (construction + materials); proof and systems first; repeatable one-SPV-per-property model. Flip remains **Plan B**: “If it’s not performing as a rental, we sell.”

## 3) Key assumptions

| Area | Assumption |
|------|------------|
| **Budget (first deal)** | Test deal < €500k (order of magnitude) |
| **Location** | Opportunity-driven (ROI / deal flow), no fixed region |
| **Investors** | Mostly cash (Canada), mainly individuals; Sam may invest via HoldCo |
| **Supplier/sweat contributions** | To be defined (invoice vs discount vs deferred payment vs upside) |
| **Debt** | Prefer 0 or low debt (cash; small mortgage only if clearly advantageous) |

---

## 4) Constraints (current situation)

- Budget: test deal under ~€500k  
- Region: opportunity-driven  
- Strategy: **STR/hybrid primary** (lifestyle-first, value-add, flexible exit); flip as Plan B  
- Operator: Sam + belle-sœur supplier network + construction contacts  
- Investors: mostly Canadian friends; mostly individuals; possible HoldCo for Sam
