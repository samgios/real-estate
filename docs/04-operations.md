# 4. Operations

## 1) Deal flow / asset selection

**Acquisition types considered:** (1) Buy existing + renovate; (2) Buy land + prefab/new construction (see 2b).

### Criteria

- ROI, exit liquidity (resale), permit complexity, construction feasibility, rental demand (if Mode C).

### Due diligence

- Title, planning/permits, renovation costs, timing, risks.

### Property selection filters (underwriting)

- Tourism or local demand drivers
- Renovation feasibility (scope, permits, structure)
- Exit liquidity (comps, buyer pool)
- Operating feasibility (access, services, furnishing)

### Research summary: Best Italian regions for STR + value-add under €500k (Feb 2026)

*Full report: `docs/research/results/06-Italian Real Estate Investment Shortlist.md`*

**Top 3 recommendations:** (1) **Valle d’Itria and Salento, Puglia** — strongest fit: established STR demand, trulli/masserie typologies, two airports, season May–Oct; €500k realistic for stone shell (€150–200k) + full reno (€200–250k). Risk: saturation in hubs (e.g. Ostuni). (2) **Val di Noto, Sicily** (Ragusa, Modica, Noto, Syracuse) — best value: €712–€1,500/m² in Baroque cities; 100 m² premium unit €400k all-in; culture + nomad demand. Risk: logistics and infrastructure. (3) **Inland Umbria** (Perugia–Todi–Orvieto) — “Tuscany at a discount,” ~€1,173/m²; €180–250k acquisition + €200k reno; Rome <2h, year-round demand. Risk: no coast, winter softer.

**Full shortlist (8):** 4. Abruzzo (coast + inland) — land+prefab feasible (e.g. €30–50k land near coast); dual-season (beach + ski). 5. Western Liguria (Riviera di Ponente) — €2.5–3k/m², compact 60–80 m² in budget; strict permits. 6. Southern Maremma / inland Tuscany (Grosseto, Arezzo) — brand resilience; vincoli and bureaucracy heavy. 7. Molise (Termoli) — hidden gem, €1,028/m²; emerging demand, low liquidity. 8. Calabria (Cedar Coast, Tropea, Scalea) — lowest entry (€958/m²); highly seasonal.

**Permit hierarchy (value-add):** CILA for non-structural works (start immediately); SCIA for structural (start immediately, 30-day municipal objection window); Permesso di Costruire for new build (3–9 months). Abruzzo and Sicily often more proactive (e.g. €1-house programs); Tuscany and Liguria stricter (vincoli, 6–12 months extra). **Renovation benchmarks:** €400–€1,500/m² depending on scope; structural overhaul (plumbing, heating, electrical) €1,000–€1,350/m². **Energy class:** Class A/B homes showed ~54% premium in 2025; prioritize insulation, heat pumps, solar for yield and resale.

**Deployment suggestion from research:** Primary target Puglia (Valle d’Itria) for high-character restoration; secondary Sicily (Val di Noto) for urban Baroque reno; aim for Energy Class A where feasible.

### Research summary: Punta Prosciutto / Salento — market, STR, permits (Feb 2026)

*Full report: `docs/research/results/09-Salento STR Market Research Report.md`*

**Context:** Punta Prosciutto is a coastal locality in **Comune Porto Cesareo** (Lecce), Ionian coast; Regional Park “Palude del Conte e Duna Costiera” + Marine Protected Area. ~40 km Lecce, ~60 km Brindisi. Caribbean-style beaches, families + nature-luxury segment. Reference area for Giuliana’s contact (Villaggio Punta Grossa, prefab/glamping).

**Prices (Porto Cesareo, Jan 2026):** Residential **€1,952/m²** (+2.68% YoY); ~62% above provincial avg €1,200. **Land:** agricultural €5–30/m² (effectively non-buildable in park); building land €100–320/m² scarce, expansion zones only. **Resale:** unrenovated villa 90–120 m² €190–350k; renovation €1,000–1,200/m²; new build/prefab turnkey €1,500–2,500/m² (excl. land). Listings in budget: villas €199–355k, B&B turnkey €480k; €300k purchase + €150–200k reno fits €500k.

**STR:** High viability; Aug occupancy 80–85%; season May–Oct (shoulder months growing). ADR Porto Cesareo ~€164; 1–2 bed / 4 guests dominant; entire-home best performer. CIN + safety (extinguishers, gas/CO detectors) mandatory from Jan 2025; key box ban (in-person or verified digital check-in). Cedolare 21%/26%; 5+ units = entrepreneurial (P.IVA). **Incentives:** **Mini PIA Turismo** (to 2027) up to 40–50% grant on purchase+reno+furnishing; Bonus Ristrutturazione 36% up to €96k (second homes).

**Permits (coastal/park):** **Permesso di Costruire** for new build or footprint/volume change: 60–90 days standard, **3–9 months** in protected areas (Soprintendenza/Parere Paesaggistico). **Vincolo Paesaggistico** dictates materials, roof (terracotta), facade (white/earth). **Reno:** SCIA structural, CILA minor. **Land + prefab:** building land rare in park; **fixed prefab on agricultural = not permitted**. Mobile/temporary units only in authorized campsite/resort or <90 days non-residential. Glamping: SCIA tourism + ASL + often VIA. **Urbanization:** Porto Cesareo ~€30/m³ + construction cost contribution (ISTAT-linked).

**Pros:** Premium Ionian beach asset; park constrains new supply; Mini PIA reduces net outlay. **Cons:** Strong seasonality (Nov–Mar minimal revenue); permit lead time can push first rental to following season; compliance adds ~5–10% operating cost; many villas on cisterns—reno should include certified water/sewage. **Strategy from research:** Best path = **buy existing unrenovated 1970s–80s villa** (secondary rows); avoid land+prefab unless plot has **permesso già rilasciato**.

## 2) Renovation / construction

### Execution model

- **Sam:** Coordination / project management
- **Local:** Contractors + suppliers (e.g. doors/windows)
- **Contracts:** Scope, schedule, payment, penalties, guarantees

### Renovation diligence

- Realistic timeline
- Contractor availability
- Permit risk and sequencing
- Contingency buffer

---

## 2b) Alternative: prefab / new construction on land

**Option:** Buy a prefab house and take the construction route—place it on land, then rent it out.

| Benefit | Note |
|--------|------|
| **Brand new building** | No existing defects or legacy issues |
| **Prefab company services** | Potentially simplifies process (design, delivery, assembly) |
| **No renovation surprises** | Avoids hidden costs and scope creep typical of reno projects |

**Origin:** Giuliana suggested this approach; she knows somebody who bought land in **Punta Prosciutto** and is having vacation units built there. That case can serve as a reference (location, supplier, process) for evaluating the prefab route.

### Research summary: prefab manufacturers (Feb 2026)

*Full report: `docs/research/results/01-Prefab Home Manufacturers For Italy.md`*

**Regions covered:** Italy (north + south/Puglia), Ukraine, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia. For a **sub-€500k all-in** project in Puglia/Salento, unit cost is only part of the budget; **accessory costs** (foundations, permits, technical fees, VAT) can be 40%+ of total—foundations €21k–€30k, municipal/urbanization fees ~€11.5k, technical/professional fees €27k–€45k for a single unit.

**Price ranges (70 m², indicative):** Italy north €1,800–€2,500/m² turnkey; Italy south/local €1,000–€1,500/m²; Ukraine €600–€1,100/m² (ex-factory); Poland €1,400–€2,000/m²; Estonia kit €250–€430/m² (factory package only). Transport to Salento: Italy north €3–5k/truck; Ukraine/Poland €7–10k/unit. Assembly (panelized): ~€8–15k (3–4 people, 1–2 weeks).

**Salento-specific:** High-salt environment, strong sun, seismic (NTC 2018). Timber must suit “thermal lag” (summer cooling); thin log cabins (e.g. 44 mm) without proper insulation are unsuitable. **Vincoli paesaggistici** (landscape constraints) near Punta Prosciutto/Porto Cesareo affect roof, finishes, vegetation—local manufacturers (e.g. COIMP, Montinaro) are used to these rules. Local reference: “Villaggio Punta Grossa” and Montinaro’s “moduli abitativi trasportabili” for luxury glamping/STR on the Ionian coast.

**Top recommendations from research (sub-€500k, single unit):**

| Priority | Company | Region | Why |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| 1 – Regional specialist | **COIMP** | Italy (Racale, Lecce) | Local to Puglia; handles vincoli, permits, Mediterranean aesthetic; bespoke timber, antisismica. Best for complex landscape constraints or stone/traditional finishes. |
| 2 – Turnkey industrial | **Dan-Wood** (NEXT Holiday) | Poland | Fixed price up to 18 months; Italian agents; vacation units 23–36 m² “ready to move in.” Best for hands-off, guaranteed cost, modern STR. |
| 3 – Value / design | **Unitfab** | Ukraine | Volumetric modular, strong design (e.g. “Black Beauty”); factory-finished; 30–50% cost vs EU possible; logistics via Poland. Best for high-ROI boutique STR, “Instagrammable,” fast deployment. |
| 4 – Budget / logistics | **Pineca** | Italy/EU | Logistics hub in Salerno (staging for Puglia); SIPs for better thermal performance; wide range (44–139 m²). Best for budget-conscious single unit or small multi-unit. |

**Other names:** Rubner Haus, Wolf Haus (Italy north, premium); Mondo Casette (Verona, ~€1–1.5k/m² turnkey 70 m²); Modul-Prefab (Ukraine, from ~€600/m² ex-factory); Norges Hus (Estonia, fast assembly, competitive kit); Montinaro Coperture (Castri di Lecce, local turnkey including foundations and utilities).

**To explore:** Land availability and cost in target areas; request quotes from COIMP, Dan-Wood, Unitfab, Pineca for a 50–70 m² STR unit; confirm VAT (4% prima casa / 10% other residential / 22% commercial) and permit path for chosen site.

### Research summary: Insurance — construction and STR (Feb 2026)

*Full report: `docs/research/results/08-Italian Property Insurance for Investors.md`*

**Construction phase:** **CAR (Contractor’s All Risks):** Section A = material damage to works (fire, explosion, atmospheric, human error); ensure pre-existing structure covered if reno affects it. Section B = third-party liability (RCT); workers covered separately by RCO. **Principal-led CAR** (S.r.l. buys policy) recommended so S.r.l. is beneficiary and all subcontractors covered. **RC Postuma (decennial):** 10-year warranty for structural collapse/grave defects; required for new build and for *ristrutturazioni pesanti* (Decree 154/2022); technical controller during works usually required to obtain it. **RC Committente:** owner’s liability for site management (often extension of CAR or standalone). **Costs (indicative):** CAR standard €400–€1k on €200k works, complex/heavy €1.8–3k; RC Postuma €500–€1.2k; legal protection €150–300/year.

**Operational phase (STR):** **Building (Fabbricato):** Insure at **reconstruction cost** (Valore di Ricostruzione), not market price—cubature ~€1.1–1.3k/m³; under-insurance triggers proportional payout reduction. Extensions: **water damage** (most common claim; include “search and repair”); atmospheric; **earthquake rider** (recommended centre/south). **Contents:** Full replacement value; ensure **unoccupancy rider** (standard policies often exclude vacancy >45–60 days). **Liability:** RCT Proprietà (building-caused) + RCT Conduzione (use/guest injury); **Ricorso Terzi** (fire spread to neighbors) — in historic centers aim €1.5M+. RCT with €500k–€1.5M limit typically **mandatory for SCIA/CIN**. **STR-specific (“Affitti Brevi”):** Guest-caused damage (accidental/malicious), theft by guests, **loss of rental income** (Lucro Cessante)—daily indemnity during repair. Platform (AirCover, Vrbo) is secondary; need **primary Italian policy** for all channels and SCIA compliance.

**S.r.l. / non-resident:** Insurers (Generali, Allianz, UnipolSai, Cattolica) cover S.r.l.-owned property; require Partita IVA, CF, **PEC**, Italian bank account (premiums via SEPA); may require local representative or property manager. **Intasure**, **Clements** (expat brokers) offer English docs and STR products; **RIB**, **Verlingue**, **Schinasi** for CAR/decennial and corporate. **AssicurazioneBedandBreakfast.it** from ~€129 for basic STR liability. CIN requires compliant RCT.

**Ballpark (annual, premium STR, €200–400k value):** Building + basic RCT €250–450; contents €150–300; STR damage/loss-of-income add-on €100–250 → **€500–€1,000 total**. Deductible often €250–500; liability ≥€1.5M recommended (Tabelle di Milano). **Minimum bundle:** Building all-risks + earthquake; RCT €1.5–2M (Proprietà + Conduzione); Ricorso Terzi; guest damage; loss of income (e.g. 12 months); legal protection (e.g. DAS, ARAG); 24/7 emergency assistance for non-resident owners.

## 3) Exploitation (if rental — Mode C)

- **Property management:** Self-manage vs local agency
- **Turnover/cleaning:** Local partners to identify
- **Standards:** Photos, listing, pricing, calendar

### Operational diligence (STR)

- Seasonality
- Local regulation risk
- Management plan (self vs local manager)

### Research summary: Italy short-term rental regulation (Feb 2026)

*Full report: `docs/research/results/05-Italy Short-Term Rental Regulations Research.md`*

**National (from 2025):** **CIN** (Codice Identificativo Nazionale) is mandatory for every unit rented for tourist use or &lt;30 days. Obtained via the national BDSR portal (Ministry of Tourism) using SPID/CIE; self-certification of safety compliance. Regional code (CIR/CIS/IUN) first where applicable, then CIN within 10 days. Listings without a valid CIN can be removed by platforms; enforcement and sanctions in effect from Jan 1, 2025. **Safety:** Portable fire extinguishers (1 per floor / 1 per 200 m²), combustible gas and CO detectors mandatory; 4+ units or professional status may require D.M. 37/2008 system certifications. **Tax:** Cedolare secca — 21% for first unit, 26% for 2nd–4th; 5+ units = “entrepreneurial” (P.IVA, INPS). Platforms withhold 21% and remit to Revenue Agency; DAC7 data sharing with authorities. **Guest reporting:** 24-hour report to Questura (*Alloggiati Web*) is mandatory; failure can be a criminal matter.

**Puglia / Salento:** Register on **DMS Puglia**; obtain CIR then CIN. **CIA** (Comunicazione di Inizio Attività) or SCIA for entrepreneurial activity — filed via municipal SUAP; for properties already operating before Sept 30, 2025, 365 days to regularize. **Mandatory civil liability (RC) insurance** for all STRs (“commensurate with receptive capacity”). Strict split: “locazioni turistiche” cannot offer breakfast, airport transfers, or daily cleaning; for those services register as CAV or B&B. **Tourist tax** (*imposta di soggiorno*) by comune (e.g. Lecce €2/night May–Oct max 7 nights; Gallipoli €1; Nardò €0.60; Otranto €1). **Monthly reporting** of arrivals/departures via **SPOT** (Sistema Puglia Osservatorio Turistico); report even zero-occupancy months.

**Other regions (brief):** Sicily: Law 6/2025, Turist@t portal, minimum dimensions (e.g. studio 28–38 m², bedroom 9–14 m²), adapt by June 30, 2026. Sardinia: IUN via RLO from Feb 2025; SIRED/Ross 1000 for monthly stats. Calabria: Albo Comunale; Ross 1000; fines €500–€5,000 for missing CIR/CIN in ads. Tuscany: municipal “criteria and limits” possible (e.g. Florence); some cities restricting self-check-in key boxes in public areas — prefer in-person check-in or smart locks without external boxes.

**Enforcement:** GdF “Ghost Host”–style checks (OTA vs bank/tax data); NAS inspections (safety/hygiene). Typical penalties: no CIN €800–€8,000; no/malfunctioning sensors €600–€6,000; omitted guest reporting (Art. 109 TULPS) fine/arrest; no SCIA €5,000–€15,000; tax omission up to 240% of tax due.

**Compliance workflow (high level):** (1) Pre-acquisition: cadastral category, structural minimums, condominium rules on STR, safety layout. (2) Onboarding: regional CIR; CIA/SCIA via SUAP; CIN via BDSR; Alloggiati Web access; SPOT/Ross 1000. (3) Launch: display CIN on plaque and in all ads; RC insurance; tourist tax registration; avoid banned key boxes where applicable. (4) Ongoing: 24h police reports; monthly statistical returns (including zero months); cedolare 21%/26% and CIN cited in tax return; bi-annual checks of extinguishers and detectors.

**Hybrid option:** *Locazione transitoria* (1–18 months) for documented need (work, study, etc.) — different from STR; can be used in low season (e.g. digital nomads) and may avoid some municipal day caps.

## 4) Decision gate (12–18 or 24 months)

At Month 12, 18, or 24 the group evaluates and votes to:

| Option | When it may apply |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Keep** | Continue as rental |
| **Sell** | Crystallize profit |
| **Refinance** | Only if attractive and feasible (e.g. partial cash-out) |

**Example triggers:**

- If NOI / occupancy / ADR meets threshold → Keep
- If market valuation or buyout demand is strong → Sell
- If refinance terms allow meaningful de-risking or capital recycling → Refi
