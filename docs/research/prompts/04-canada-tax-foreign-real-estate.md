## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research how Canadian tax law and reporting obligations apply when Canadian residents invest in Italian real estate—either directly or through a foreign entity (e.g. an Italian S.r.l.).

**Context:** A group of Canadian individuals (friends/family) plan to invest in one Italian residential property, held via an Italian limited company (S.r.l.). The property will be renovated and either rented short-term or sold. We need to understand reporting and tax treatment before structuring and before meeting a Canadian tax advisor.

**What we need:**
1. **Foreign asset reporting** — T1134 (foreign affiliate?), T1135 (specified foreign property?), and any other forms or disclosures required when a Canadian holds an interest in a foreign corporation that holds real estate. Thresholds, deadlines, penalties for non-compliance.
2. **Tax treatment of rental income** — how is income from the Italian property (flowing through the entity or directly) taxed in Canada? Deductions, foreign tax credit, which country taxes what.
3. **Tax treatment of capital gain on sale** — if the property (or the shares of the S.r.l.) is sold, how is the gain taxed in Canada? Any treaty (Italy–Canada) points to highlight.
4. **Personal vs HoldCo** — if an investor invests personally vs through a Canadian HoldCo, what are the main differences in reporting and tax? Which is commonly used for EU real estate by Canadians?
5. **Common structures** — what structures do Canadian investors typically use for owning EU (e.g. Italian) real estate (direct, foreign corp, trust, etc.)? Brief pros/cons of 2–3 approaches.
6. **Questions to bring to a Canadian tax advisor** — list 5–10 specific questions we should ask when we do a structure-only call with a Canadian tax advisor experienced in foreign assets.

**Output format:** A report with sections for each of the above. Include a one-page summary: key reporting forms and deadlines, one-sentence treatment for rental and for sale, and "top 3 things to clarify with a tax advisor."

**Scope:** Canadian federal (and provincial where material). Mention Italy–Canada treaty where relevant. Do not constitute legal or tax advice; frame as "what to research and what to ask an advisor."
