## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Identify prefab / modular / prefabricated home manufacturers that could supply a single-family or small vacation unit for a project in Italy. Prioritize best value (price, quality, delivery) rather than luxury only.

**Geographic scope:**
- **Italy** — manufacturers based in Italy (preferred for logistics and local standards).
- **Ukraine** — manufacturers that could supply to Italy (we have Ukrainian partners; consider cost advantage and EU delivery).
- **Nearby / EU** — Slovenia, Austria, Poland, or other countries that could deliver to Italy at a competitive total cost (land + build).

**What we need:**
1. **List of companies** — name, country, type (modular, panelized, volumetric, etc.), typical product (e.g. single-family, small multi-unit).
2. **Rough price ranges** (if findable) — per m² or per unit, and whether land/permits/foundations are included.
3. **Delivery to Italy** — which of these actually deliver to Italy (or to a specific region, e.g. Puglia/Salento); lead times and any known constraints.
4. **Pros and cons** — e.g. Italy = local compliance and logistics; Ukraine = possible cost savings but logistics/war risk; other EU = balance of cost and proximity.
5. **One concrete reference** — if you find a real example (e.g. vacation units in Punta Prosciutto or similar) with builder name, include it.

**Output format:** A short report with sections by region (Italy, Ukraine, nearby EU), then a comparison table and 3–5 recommended options with a sentence each on why they might be a good fit for a sub-€500k project in Italy.

**Constraints:** We are a small group (one SPV, one property). We need suppliers who can do a single unit or a small batch, not only large developments.
