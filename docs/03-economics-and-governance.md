# 3. Economics and governance

## 1) Economics — two modes (structure supports both)

### Mode A — Flip-compatible

- **Priority:** Return of capital (and/or shareholder loans if used)
- **Then:** Profit share by % or waterfall (to be defined)
- **Operator:** Possible success fee, conditional on performance

### Mode C — Premium short-term rental

- **Priority:** Operating costs + reserves + optional preferred cash return (if adopted)
- **Distribution:** Per policy (e.g. monthly/quarterly)
- **Reinvestment:** Option to retain profits in SPV for works/improvements/accumulation

### Open points (decisions)

- Do cash investors get a preferred return (capital first / preferred interest)?
- Operator remuneration: monthly fee + success fee? (and conditions)
- Suppliers: full invoice vs discount vs deferred payment vs upside?

## 2) Waterfall design (target — investor-friendly)

**Design goals:** Protect investors first; align operator with performance; avoid precise sweat-equity valuation on Day 1.

### On liquidity event (sale or refinance distribution)

Structure that doesn’t force you to value sweat equity on Day 1: **they fund, you deliver.**

1. **Return of capital** to investors (equity back) — they get their money back before you get rich
2. **Preferred return** to investors — e.g. 6–10% annual (depending on risk)
3. **Remaining profit split** — operator earns a **carry** (e.g. 20–30%) for executing the deal. Example: 70% investors / 30% operator; alternate 80/20

### During operations (rental cashflow)

1. Operating expenses, reserves
2. Debt service (if any)
3. Management fees (if any)
4. Distribution to investors per policy (or retention for growth)

**Pitch line:** “You get paid back first; I only make meaningful upside after you’re taken care of.”

## 3) Operator compensation (avoid sweat-valuation fights)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Management / project fee** | Modest, justified, covers real work |
| **Success fee** | Milestone-based (e.g. on-time, on-budget completion) |
| **Carry** | Profit share after investor protections |

**Accountability:** Written deliverables, reporting cadence, replacement clause (if abandonment / gross negligence).

## 4) Governance — who decides what

### Operational signatory (Italy)

- **Sam** (or mandated person) for day-to-day execution.

### Decisions reserved to investor vote

- Acquisition (max price, conditions)
- Renovation budget + contingency
- Material scope change
- Sale / refinance / strategy change
- Choice of property manager (if applicable)

### Voting (to define)

- Simple majority vs supermajority (e.g. 66%) for key decisions
- Special rights by contribution (if any)

### Operational vs reserved (LP/GP style)

| Operator discretion (within budget) | Investor vote required |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Vendor coordination, scheduling, procurement | Acquire or sell the property |
| Listing, operations, guest communications | Refinance / new debt |
| | Budget increases above threshold |
| | Material scope change |
| | Change of property manager |

**Examples:** Standard major decisions = simple majority; sale/refi = supermajority (e.g. 66%); emergency spend above cap = majority + notice.

## 5) Reporting and transparency

**Minimum — monthly investor pack:**

- Cash in/out summary
- Renovation progress vs timeline
- Budget vs actual (with variance notes)
- Photos and milestone checklist
- Rental metrics (if operating): occupancy, ADR, revenue, expenses
- Next-month plan

**Discipline:** Single ledger; every invoice stored and indexed; bank statements reconciled.
