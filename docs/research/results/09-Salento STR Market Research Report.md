# **Analysis of the Real Estate and Short-Term Rental Market in Punta Prosciutto and the Salento Peninsula**

## **Strategic Investment Overview: One-Page Executive Summary**

The investment landscape of the Salento coastal region, specifically the high-demand micro-market of Punta Prosciutto within the municipality of Porto Cesareo, presents a compelling but complex opportunity for residential development and short-term rental (STR) operations. As of the 2024–2025 period, the market is characterized by a transition from informal "summer letting" to a highly regulated, professionalized tourism sector. For investors targeting a budget under €500,000, the "buy and renovate" model remains the most statistically viable path to entry, while the "land plus prefab" model faces significant hurdles due to landscape protections and urban planning constraints.1

### **Asset Pricing and Market Benchmarks**

A quantitative analysis of the Porto Cesareo municipality reveals a premium coastal market with an average residential asking price of €1,952 per m² as of January 2026, representing a 2.68% increase from the previous year.4 This premium is driven by the area's Caribbean-style beaches and protected natural dunes.5

| Investment Component | Lower Bound (Est.) | Upper Bound (Est.) | Strategic Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agricultural Land (Non-buildable)** | €5/m² | €30/m² | Primarily for parking or non-permanent use.7 |
| **Building Land (Edificabile)** | €100/m² | €320/m² | Scarce; often found in "expansion" zones.9 |
| **Resale Villa (Unrenovated)** | €190,000 | €350,000 | Typical 90–120 m² structure.11 |
| **Renovation Cost (Standard)** | €1,000/m² | €1,200/m² | Includes systems and mid-range finishes.1 |
| **New Build/Prefab (Turnkey)** | €1,500/m² | €2,500/m² | Excludes land; includes professional fees.1 |

### **Market Performance and Viability**

* **STR Viability:** **High**. Demand is concentrated in the summer months with August occupancy reaching 80–85% in prime coastal segments.14  
* **Target Audience:** Families seeking shallow waters and high-end "nature-luxury" travelers.5  
* **Regulatory Risk:** **High**. New National Identification Code (CIN) requirements and mandatory safety standards came into full effect on January 1, 2025\.16

### **Investor Guidance: Strategy and Risks**

* **Best For:** Investors pursuing a "value-add" strategy by purchasing 1970s–1980s stock and modernizing for the premium STR market.1  
* **Watch Out For:** Non-buildable land sold with "potential" building rights; the *Vincolo Paesaggistico* (Landscape Constraint) which can delay permits by up to 9 months; and the recent ban on unmonitored key boxes.17

## **Location and Character: The Ionian Pearl and Regional Context**

### **Geographical and Administrative Identity**

Punta Prosciutto is a prominent coastal locality situated on the western shore of the Salento peninsula, overlooking the Ionian Sea. It is administratively part of the *Comune* (Municipality) of Porto Cesareo, located in the Province of Lecce.5 The area is geographically positioned between the towns of Porto Cesareo and Torre Colimena, and it is a central feature of the Regional Natural Park "Palude del Conte e Duna Costiera" and the Porto Cesareo Marine Protected Area.5

The locality is accessible via provincial roads, specifically the SP119 and SP21 from Lecce, and the SP359 which connects the interior to the coast.5 It is approximately 40 kilometers from the baroque city of Lecce and 60 kilometers from the Salento Airport in Brindisi, which serves as the primary international gateway to the region.21

### **Environmental Character and Tourism Profile**

The unique character of Punta Prosciutto stems from its "Caribbean" aesthetic, characterized by fine white sand and turquoise, crystal-clear waters.5 Unlike more urbanized Italian coastal resorts, Punta Prosciutto has maintained a wilder, more natural environment due to its protected status.6 The beach system is defined by massive sand dunes that reach heights of up to 8 meters, interspersed with Mediterranean scrub (*macchia mediterranea*).6

The tourist profile is predominantly driven by nature seekers and families. The shallow and gently sloping seabed remains safe for swimming up to several dozen meters from the shore, making it highly desirable for families with children.5 During the peak summer season, particularly July and August, the area experiences high density, while the "shoulder" months of June and September attract a demographic interested in tranquility and outdoor sports such as windsurfing and kitesurfing.5

### **Strategic Position within Salento and Puglia**

In the broader context of Puglia, Punta Prosciutto is a key asset in the Salento "sun and sea" tourism product. While the Adriatic coast of Salento (Otranto, Melendugno) is known for its cliffs and rocky coves, the Ionian coast, and Punta Prosciutto in particular, is the premier destination for sandy beach enthusiasts.5 It serves as a quieter alternative to the more commercialized hubs of Gallipoli, though its proximity to Porto Cesareo and Torre Lapillo ensures that guests have access to high-end seafood markets, restaurants, and nightlife within a 15–20 minute drive.6

## **The Salento Real Estate Market: Pricing, Trends, and Dynamics**

### **Analysis of Property Prices in Porto Cesareo and Surroundings**

The real estate market in Porto Cesareo, the administrative heart of the Punta Prosciutto area, has demonstrated significant resilience and growth. By January 2026, the asking price for residential properties reached an average of €1,952 per m², highlighting the premium status of this coastal municipality.4

The following table provides a comprehensive comparison of residential sale prices across the Province of Lecce, illustrating the relative cost of investing in Porto Cesareo versus neighboring inland or coastal areas.

| Municipality | Sale Price (€/m²) | Rent Price (€/m²/month) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Porto Cesareo** | **€1,952** | **€8.08** |
| Lecce | €1,651 | €9.09 |
| Gallipoli | €1,968 | €8.35 |
| Otranto | €1,960 | €11.10 |
| Nardò | €1,366 | €6.75 |
| Manduria | €1,430 (Est.) | €9.30 (Est.) |
| Casarano | €738 | €7.30 |
| Veglie | €791 | €5.40 |
| Salve | €1,924 | €7.32 |
| Ugento | €1,300 | €14.67 |
| Alliste | €1,024 | €6.95 |

4

Porto Cesareo’s pricing is approximately 62% higher than the provincial average of €1,200/m², driven largely by the scarcity of residential units near the protected marine area.4 The month with the lowest historical pricing in the recent cycle was May 2024, when the average dipped to €1,741 per m², suggesting a seasonal oscillation in listing behavior or the closure of lower-value inland sales during that period.4

### **Detailed Inventory of Current Offerings in Punta Prosciutto**

Listing data from 2024 and 2025 provides concrete examples of the properties available for investors within a €500,000 budget. While luxury villas on the frontline can exceed €1.1 million, the mid-market is well-populated with independent villas and semi-detached units.11

| Property Type | Location | Size | Price | Key Features |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Independent Villa | Via 229, Punta Prosciutto | 90 m² | €260,000 | 1,000 m² garden; near beach entry.12 |
| Renovated Villa | Via 295, Punta Prosciutto | 120 m² | €345,000 | Fully renovated; 300m from Lido Samanà.12 |
| Villa with Annex | Via 290, Punta Prosciutto | 90 m² | €355,000 | 100m from sea; dual rental potential.12 |
| B\&B Establishment | Via 301, Punta Prosciutto | 350 m² | €480,000 | 5 ensuite bedrooms; turnkey operation.11 |
| Detached House | Via Sauli Scassi, P.P. | 120 m² | €215,000 | Frontline proximity; large garden.12 |
| Two-Level Villa | Via 270, Punta Prosciutto | 200 m² | €199,000 | 680 m² garden; 200m from sea.12 |

These data points confirm that the €500,000 budget is ample for acquiring a high-quality existing property in the Punta Prosciutto area. Even accounting for a thorough modernization, an investor purchasing at the €300,000 mark would have €200,000 remaining for renovations, which exceeds the standard budget for a 100 m² overhaul.1

### **Land Prices and Urban Planning Designations**

The land market in Punta Prosciutto is bifurcated between agricultural land (*terreno agricolo*) and building land (*terreno edificabile*). This distinction is the most common pitfall for foreign investors.28

* **Agricultural Land (E1 Zone):** Dominates the landscape. Prices are low, typically between €3,000 and €15,000 for small plots (300–500 m²) and up to €90,000 for large 9-hectare estates.7 While these lots are marketed for their "proximity to the sea," they carry a buildability index of approximately ![][image1], which effectively prohibits any residential construction unless the owner is a professional farmer.30  
* **Building Land:** Extremely rare within the park boundaries. Prices in the Porto Cesareo urban center or peripheral expansion zones range from €50/m² to €300/m².1 A 1,040 m² plot in a central location was recently listed for €800,000, illustrating the extreme premium for confirmed building rights.8

### **Recent Trends and Market Outlook (2023–2025)**

The Salento real estate market is currently experiencing a "mild recovery" driven by international buyers, with a 1% year-on-year increase in overall regional interest.32 In coastal hotspots like Porto Cesareo, the appreciation is higher (2.68%), suggesting that premium beach locations are decoupling from the general Italian trend of stagnant prices.4 There is a visible shift toward "ready-to-rent" properties, as evidenced by the high prices for renovated villas compared to older stock.11

## **Short-Term Rental Demand and Performance Analytics**

### **Demand Seasonality and Revenue Profiles**

The short-term rental market in Punta Prosciutto and the wider Salento coast is highly seasonal, but recent data indicates a robust expansion of the tourist window. Traditionally limited to July and August, the season now effectively spans from May to October.24

| Market Segment | Avg. Daily Rate (ADR) | Avg. Occupancy | Monthly Rev. (Peak) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Porto Cesareo (Coast)** | €164 | 35.3% | €4,000+ (Est.) |
| **Lecce (City Center)** | €138 | 37.4% | €2,686 |
| **Alberobello (Inland)** | €177 | 37.3% | €3,522 |
| **Gallipoli (Coast)** | €154 | 34.8% | N/A |
| **Puglia Region (Avg)** | €130 | 44.1% | €1,339 |

25

Occupancy rates in August typically peak at 80% to 85% for coastal properties, while January and February represent the low point with occupancy dropping below 20%.14 However, the "shoulder" months of September and October saw a 3% increase in demand in the most recent cycle, with RevPAR rising by 20% in October alone.35 This trend is attributed to the rise of cultural tourism and digital nomads seeking warmer climates in the autumn.15

### **Guest Demographics and Accommodation Trends**

The primary segment for Punta Prosciutto remains families and small groups. Data from Lecce and Porto Cesareo shows that:

* **1 and 2-bedroom listings** make up over 70% of the market, catering to couples and small families.33  
* **Capacity for 4 guests** is the most common guest configuration (approx. 29–34% of listings).33  
* **International arrivals** are growing, with a significant increase in North American tourists (+27%) and a dominant presence from French and Irish visitors in high-end rentals.38

Properties that offer "entire home" privacy are significantly more successful than shared room listings, accounting for 70–100% of the top-performing inventory in coastal segments.39

### **Performance Drivers for Premium STRs**

Investors can achieve "best-in-class" performance (Top 10%) by optimizing their listings for these verified drivers:

1. **Safety Compliance:** Properties with the new CIN code and visible safety equipment (extinguishers, gas detectors) have seen a marked increase in guest trust and booking volume.35  
2. **Long-term Availability:** 56% of high-performing properties in Salento are available for 271–366 days a year, even if they only achieve high occupancy in the summer.33  
3. **Extended Stay Strategy:** There is a significant segment (approx. 37%) of the market moving toward 30+ night stays, particularly for retirees and remote workers in the spring and autumn.33

## **Regulatory Framework: Short-Term Rental Compliance in 2025**

### **The National Identification Code (CIN)**

The Italian regulatory landscape for short-term rentals underwent a radical transformation in late 2024\. As of **January 1, 2025**, all residential units intended for short-term rental (stays under 30 days) must possess a National Identification Code (Codice Identificativo Nazionale \- CIN).16

* **Mandatory Display:** The CIN must be displayed on a plaque outside the building and included in all online advertisements.16  
* **Registration Process:** Owners must request the CIN via the Ministry of Tourism’s portal, providing cadastral data and certifying compliance with safety standards.16  
* **Transition from CIR:** While the CIN is national, regional codes like Puglia’s CIR are still currently required alongside the CIN during the 2025 transition period.42

### **Mandatory Safety and Installation Standards**

All apartments designated for tourist use must now meet specific safety criteria previously reserved for commercial hotels.16

| Requirement | Specification | Enforcement Date |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Fire Extinguishers** | Minimum 1 per floor; 1 per 200 m² of floor space.16 | Jan 1, 2025 |
| **Gas & CO Detectors** | Must be functional and installed in rooms with gas appliances or boilers.16 | Jan 1, 2025 |
| **System Certification** | Electrical and heating systems must have a *dichiarazione di conformità*.19 | Jan 1, 2025 |
| **Key Box Restriction** | Prohibition on unmonitored key boxes on public fixtures; personal greeting or verified digital check-in required.17 | Nov 18, 2024 |

### **Taxation and Legal Classification**

For private individuals (natural persons) operating STRs, the following tax rules apply:

* **Cedolare Secca (Flat Tax):** 21% on the first property; 26% on properties 2 through 4\.17  
* **Entrepreneurial Threshold:** Owning or managing 5 or more properties automatically classifies the activity as a business, requiring a *Partita IVA* and adherence to corporate tax and social security (INPS/INAIL) requirements.42  
* **Contractual Limits:** Rentals must not exceed 30 consecutive days per guest to qualify as a "short lease" (*locazione breve*).43

## **The Development Process: Permits, Timelines, and Construction Costs**

### **Navigating the Permesso di Costruire (Building Permit)**

In Puglia, particularly in coastal zones like Punta Prosciutto, any construction that changes the footprint, volume, or external appearance of a building requires a **Permesso di Costruire**.19

* **Process:** The application must be filed by a licensed professional (Geometra, Architect, or Engineer) through the municipality's *Sportello Unico per l'Edilizia* (SUE).45  
* **Timeline:** Municipal review typically takes **60 to 90 days** for standard applications, but can extend to **3–9 months** in protected areas due to additional commission reviews.19  
* **Validity:** Work must start within 1 year of issuance and be completed within 3 years.19

### **Landscape Constraints: Vincolo Paesaggistico**

Because Punta Prosciutto is situated within a regional park and a coastal zone, it is subject to the **Vincolo Paesaggistico**.19

* **Landscape Approval:** Any project must receive a "Parere Paesaggistico" from the local landscape commission or the *Soprintendenza*.48  
* **Restrictions:** These constraints often dictate the type of materials (e.g., local stone), roof styles (terracotta tiles), and facade colors (typically white or earth tones) that can be used.19

### **Renovation Permits: SCIA and CILA**

For "buy and renovate" projects, simpler procedures may suffice:

* **SCIA (Segnalazione Certificata di Inizio Attività):** Used for structural restorations or changes in the building's internal layout. Work can technically start immediately after filing, though the municipality has 30 days to raise objections.19  
* **CILA (Comunicazione di Inizio Lavori Asseverata):** For minor works such as bathroom updates, floor replacement, or moving non-structural walls.45

### **Construction and Renovation Costs (2025 Projections)**

The following tables synthesize current market data for construction in the Puglia region, accounting for ISTAT inflation updates.50

| Renovation Activity | Average Cost per m² | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **New Roof (Terracotta)** | €125 – €175 | Includes removal of old material.47 |
| **Flooring (Parquet/Porcelain)** | €40 – €120 | Wide variation based on material.13 |
| **Electrical Rewiring** | €35 – €45 | Mandatory for conformity cert.47 |
| **Exterior Painting** | €14 – €80 | Higher if scaffolding is required.47 |
| **Kitchen Remodel** | €500 – €1,000 | Includes plumbing and installation.47 |
| **Full Internal Renovation** | **€600 – €1,100** | "Guts" redo; systems \+ finishes.1 |

For a **New Build or Prefab House**, costs are significantly higher due to urbanization fees and higher performance standards.1

| Construction Type | Price per m² (Turnkey) | Cost for 100 m² Unit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic Prefab | €1,100 – €1,400 | €110,000 – €140,000 1 |
| Standard Prefab (Wood/Steel) | €1,500 – €1,900 | €150,000 – €190,000 1 |
| Luxury Traditional Build | €2,000 – €2,800 | €200,000 – €280,000 1 |

**Urbanization Costs (Oneri di Urbanizzazione):** In Porto Cesareo, these fees for new builds are approximately €30/m³ for standard residential projects, plus a "cost of construction" contribution which is updated annually by ISTAT (approx. €854 per m² base for new builds in 2025).50

### **Legal Status of Prefab and Mobile Homes**

A critical distinction exists between "mobile" and "fixed" prefab units:

* **Fixed Prefabs:** Require the same permits and building land as a traditional brick house. Attempting to place a prefab on agricultural land is a crime.54  
* **Mobile Homes on Wheels:** Can only be legally sited without a building permit if they are truly temporary (under 90 days) and used for non-residential purposes, OR if they are placed within an authorized tourism business (campsite/resort).54  
* **Glamping Permits:** Setting up luxury tents or domes requires a **SCIA for tourism activity**, ASL health approval, and often a "Valutazione di Impatto Ambientale" (Environmental Impact Assessment).44

## **Regional Incentives: Mini PIA Turismo and Tax Bonuses**

Investors should be aware of significant financial support mechanisms available in Puglia until 2027\.

### **Mini PIA Turismo (2025–2027)**

This EU-funded program provides grants for the creation of new tourism accommodations.2

* **Funding Level:** Up to **40%–50%** of total investment (purchase \+ renovation \+ furnishing) can be recovered as a non-repayable grant.2  
* **Mechanism:** Investors typically provide 25% equity, secure 75% bank financing, and receive the grant payout in the second year of operation.2  
* **Priorities:** Restoration of historical buildings, energy efficiency, and projects that promote de-seasonalization.58

### **Italy Renovation Tax Credit 2026 (Bonus Ristrutturazione)**

For private residential owners, the national tax credit is still accessible:

* **Second Homes:** A **36% tax deduction** on renovation costs up to €96,000 per property.60  
* **Mechanism:** Deducted from the owner's Italian income tax (*IRPEF*) over a 10-year period.60  
* **Requirement:** Payment must be made through a "bonifico parlante" bank transfer.60

## **Strategic Assessment for a €500k Short-Term Rental Project**

### **Pros of a Punta Prosciutto / Salento Investment**

* **Premium Positioning:** Punta Prosciutto is the highest-tier beach asset on the Ionian coast, commanding higher ADRs than neighboring towns.5  
* **Protected Market:** The park boundaries act as a supply constraint. Once a legal building is owned and renovated, its value is protected by the impossibility of new high-density development nearby.6  
* **High ROI Potential:** With de-seasonalization trends and the Mini PIA Turismo grants, the net capital outlay for a high-end villa can be significantly reduced, leading to higher cash-on-cash returns.24

### **Cons and Risk Factors**

* **Extreme Seasonality:** The low season (November–March) is almost entirely devoid of revenue. The project must survive on 6–7 months of income.33  
* **Administrative Friction:** The 9-month permit wait time for coastal zones means that a purchase in early 2025 may not be ready for the rental market until the 2026 season.19  
* **Compliance Costs:** Professionalizing an STR—meeting all safety, insurance, and tax registration requirements—adds an estimated 5–10% to annual operating costs.42  
* **Water Scarcity:** Many older villas in Punta Prosciutto rely on cisterns (*cisterna*) for water supply. Investors must ensure that any renovation includes a high-capacity, certified water and sewage system to meet guest expectations and modern hygiene standards.61

### **Conclusion: Strategic Recommendation**

For an investor with a sub-€500k budget, the most prudent strategy is the **acquisition of a legally existing, unrenovated 1970s–80s villa** in the secondary rows of the Punta Prosciutto settlement. This avoids the high cost of beachfront premiums while maintaining proximity to the water. By allocating €300,000 for purchase and €150,000 for a deep renovation (including solar panels and smart home systems), the investor can create a premium product that targets the growing international and family segments. The "land plus prefab" model is discouraged unless a plot with already-issued building rights (*permesso già rilasciato*) is found, as the permitting risks in the Regional Park are too significant for a fixed-budget timeline. Success will ultimately hinge on leveraging the **Mini PIA Turismo** grants and ensuring 100% urbanistic compliance (*conformità*) to navigate the new, strict 2025 regulatory landscape.
