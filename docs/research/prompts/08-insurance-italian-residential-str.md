## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research what types of insurance are standard or recommended for (a) an Italian residential property used for short-term rental, and (b) the same property during the renovation or construction phase. Include whether coverage is available when the owner is a non-resident-owned Italian company (S.r.l.).

**Context:** We are a small group (Canadian investors) holding one Italian residential property per Italian S.r.l. We will renovate (or build) and then operate as premium short-term rental. We need to know what insurance we should have in place and what it typically costs.

**What we need:**
1. **Property insurance** — building, contents. What is standard in Italy for a second home or investment property? Any exclusions for short-term rental or for non-resident-owned companies?
2. **Liability insurance** — third-party liability for the property and for STR (guests). Is there a specific product for "affitti brevi" or do standard policies cover it? Minimum levels commonly required or recommended?
3. **STR-specific policies** — any insurance products in Italy (or internationally) designed for short-term rental (e.g. damage by guests, loss of rental income)? Names of products or insurers if findable.
4. **Construction / renovation phase** — what insurance is typically required or recommended during works? Builder's risk, liability for contractors, etc. Who usually arranges it (owner vs contractor)?
5. **Non-resident-owned SPV** — do Italian (or international) insurers readily cover a property owned by an S.r.l. whose shareholders are non-resident? Any common exclusions or requirements (e.g. Italian address, resident representative)?
6. **Ballpark costs** — indicative annual premiums for a single vacation property (e.g. €200k–€400k value) for: (a) building + basic liability, (b) STR-specific if available. In EUR.

**Output format:** A report with sections: Property / Liability / STR-specific / Construction phase / SPV and non-residents / Costs. Include a short "recommended minimum coverage" list and 3–5 Italian insurers or brokers to consider (with a note if they serve non-resident-owned entities).

**Scope:** Italy-focused. Include EU or international insurers that commonly cover Italian residential if relevant.
