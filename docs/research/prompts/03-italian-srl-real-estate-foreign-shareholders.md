## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research what it takes to set up and run an Italian S.r.l. (società a responsabilità limitata) that holds a single residential property, where the shareholders are Canadian residents (non-resident in Italy).

**Context:** We plan one Italian S.r.l. per property for risk isolation and scalability. The company will: hold title to the property, contract with suppliers and contractors, receive rental or sale proceeds, and pay costs and taxes. We need a clear picture of setup and ongoing obligations before engaging an Avvocato and Commercialista in Italy.

**What we need:**
1. **Incorporation steps** — chronological steps to form the S.r.l. (including notary, registration, tax registration, bank account). Timeline from start to operational.
2. **Setup costs** — ballpark one-time costs (notary, registration fees, professional fees). In EUR.
3. **Annual / ongoing obligations** — accounting, filing, tax returns, audit (if required). Cost per year (ballpark).
4. **Director and representation** — can the director be non-resident? Is an Italian resident director or legal representative required? What are the risks or complications?
5. **Pitfalls for foreign owners** — common mistakes, tax traps, administrative issues that affect non-resident shareholders. Any reporting or disclosure to Italian authorities?
6. **What to ask a Commercialista** — list of 5–10 specific questions we should bring to an Italian accountant/tax advisor when we do the structure-only call.

**Output format:** A report with clear sections (Setup / Costs / Ongoing / Director / Pitfalls / Questions for advisor). Include a one-page summary at the top with: total setup cost range, annual cost range, and 3 main red flags for foreign shareholders.

**Scope:** Italy only. Focus on S.r.l. (not S.r.l.s. or other forms) used for holding one residential real estate asset.
