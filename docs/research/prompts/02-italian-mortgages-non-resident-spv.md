## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research the conditions, requirements, and typical terms for Italian residential mortgages when the borrower is an Italian S.r.l. (limited company) owned by non-resident shareholders (e.g. Canadian individuals).

**Context:** We are a small group of Canadian investors planning to hold one Italian residential property per Italian S.r.l. Budget for the first deal is under €500k. We prefer low or no debt for the first deal but may use a small mortgage; refinance may matter for future deals. We need to know what is actually available, not only in theory.

**What we need:**
1. **Which banks or products** lend to an Italian S.r.l. whose shareholders are non-resident (e.g. Canadian)? List any that are known to do this, and any that explicitly do not.
2. **Typical terms** — LTV (loan-to-value), interest rates (range or current levels), term (e.g. 15–25 years), currency (EUR).
3. **Requirements** — documents, guarantees, minimum income or asset levels, Italian bank account, resident director, etc.
4. **Main hurdles** — what usually blocks or delays such financing, and how have other non-resident investors (or their vehicles) solved them (e.g. Italian co-signer, specific bank, structure)?
5. **Refinance** — after renovation or value-add, is refinancing common in Italy for this type of borrower, and on what conditions?

**Output format:** A structured report with: (a) list of accessible banks/products or a clear statement that options are limited; (b) a summary table of terms and requirements; (c) a short section on hurdles and workarounds; (d) 3–5 practical takeaways for a Canadian-led Italian SPV.

**Geographic focus:** Italy. If relevant, mention any EU or international lenders that lend against Italian residential real estate.
