## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research the step-by-step process of buying a residential property in Italy, including costs, taxes, and timeline. Cover both buying an existing building and buying land for construction, and both buying as a foreign individual and buying via an Italian company (e.g. S.r.l.).

**Context:** We are Canadian investors planning to acquire Italian residential property through an Italian S.r.l. (one company per property). We need a clear, practical description of the process for underwriting and for explaining to investors. Budget for the first deal is under €500k.

**What we need:**
1. **Step-by-step process** — from first step (e.g. offer, preliminary contract) to closing (deed, registration). Number the steps and briefly describe each. Include: offer/negotiation, compromesso (preliminary contract), notary appointment, deed (rogito), registration, handover.
2. **Notary role** — what does the notary do? What documents do they prepare or verify? Typical notary fees (range or %).
3. **Taxes and official costs** — imposta di registro (or other transfer taxes), cadastral and mortgage taxes, notary fees. Who pays what? Give a cost breakdown: either as percentages of purchase price or as illustrative amounts (e.g. for a €300k or €400k purchase). Specify whether figures apply to "first home" (prima casa) or not, and the difference if relevant.
4. **Typical timeline** — how long from offer (or compromesso) to closing? What are the usual bottlenecks?
5. **Buying land for construction** — how does the process differ when buying land (e.g. for a prefab or new build)? Any extra taxes, permits, or steps? Differences in notary or registration?
6. **Buyer as Italian company (S.r.l.)** — any differences in process or cost when the buyer is an S.r.l. rather than an individual (Italian or foreign)?

**Output format:** A report with sections: Process (step-by-step) / Notary / Taxes and costs (with a summary table or example) / Timeline / Land vs existing building / Buyer as S.r.l. Include a one-page "cheat sheet": 10 steps in order, total cost range as % of purchase price, and typical timeline in weeks or months.

**Scope:** Italy. Use current rules (2024–2025). Note where "prima casa" benefits apply and where they do not (e.g. for a company).
