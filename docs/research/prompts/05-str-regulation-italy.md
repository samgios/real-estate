## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research the current legal and regulatory framework for short-term rentals in Italy (Affitti brevi), at both national and regional/municipal level.

**Context:** We plan to operate an Italian residential property as a premium short-term rental (or hybrid). We need to know what is required to be compliant and what risks we face. Regions of interest include Puglia (e.g. Salento) and any other areas where sub-€500k deals with STR demand exist.

**What we need:**
1. **National framework** — what does Italian national law say about short-term rentals? Definitions (e.g. max stay to count as "breve"), registration requirements, tax (cedolare secca?), any national caps or restrictions.
2. **Regional and municipal rules** — how do regions (and possibly municipalities) add to or differ from national rules? Focus on: Puglia, and 2–3 other regions that are relevant for vacation STR (e.g. Sicily, Sardinia, Tuscany, Calabria). Registration, caps on days or number of properties, zoning, tourist tax.
3. **Puglia / Salento specifics** — if findable, summarize the rules that apply specifically in Puglia or the Salento area for STR.
4. **Penalties and enforcement** — what happens if you don't register or don't comply? Fines, bans, recent enforcement trends (e.g. crackdowns in certain cities).
5. **Recent and planned changes** — any 2024–2025 changes or proposed laws that affect STR in Italy.
6. **Compliance checklist** — a simple list of steps (e.g. register with X, pay Y, display Z) that an operator should follow to be compliant.

**Output format:** A report with sections: National / Regional (with subsections per region) / Puglia–Salento / Penalties & enforcement / Recent changes / Checklist. Include a one-page summary with "must-do" items and main risks.

**Sources:** Prefer official or authoritative sources (government, tax agency, industry bodies). Note where rules are unclear or vary by comune.
