## 1) The product (simple explanation)

**“Italy Home Club — Deal #1”**

A clean, productized concept (easy to sell to friends): membership-like dream with clear rules.

### Deal #1 shape (target)

| Element | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Properties | 1 property |
| Investors | 6–10 max (friends) |
| Minimum ticket | €25k–€50k (example) |
| Target hold | 18–36 months |
| Lifestyle use | e.g. each €25k = 3–5 nights/year (blackout dates apply) |
| Operator | You manage everything for a fee + carry |

### Investor experience

- Own a share of an Italian home
- Benefit from value creation (renovation + repositioning)
- Earn income from premium rental
- Optional lifestyle access (stays/credits) under clear rules
- No day-to-day management; operator handles Italy complexity

### Reassurance

- **Not open-ended:** decision gate at 12–18 (or 24) months
- **Downside:** budget controls, governance, capped (or no) capital calls

## 1b) The 5 things you must define (to make it irresistible and safe)

| # | Area | What to define |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Personal-use policy** | Nights/credits, booking rules, damage deposit, cleaning fees |
| 2 | **Capital call policy** | “No surprises”: either no capital calls, or a pre-approved max |
| 3 | **Operator accountability** | Deliverables + removal clause if operator disappears |
| 4 | **Exit policy** | 12/18/24-month decision gate + buyout option |
| 5 | **Reporting cadence** | Monthly dashboard, receipts, transparency |

## 2) The four hooks (“what’s in it for them”)

These are the hooks that actually work for friends:

1. **Italy ownership without headaches**  
   You handle sourcing, renovations, operations, and local vendor coordination. They don’t have to move there, manage contractors, or learn the system.

2. **Two returns in one**  
   - **Financial:** value-add renovation + rental income  
   - **Lifestyle dividend:** limited personal stays (optional), or a “credit” system  

3. **Clear downside protection**  
   The asset is tangible. They’re not signing up for endless capital calls. You set a hard rule: max budget + contingency + stop-loss.

4. **A simple “decision moment”**  
   At month 12 or 18: if numbers are great → keep; if not → sell. Comforting for friend-investors.

### Best positioning line (what you’re really selling)

*“You get a piece of Italy—professionally executed—where your downside is structured and your upside comes from both renovation value and rental performance. You don’t have to move there, manage contractors, or learn the system. I’m the bridge.”*

---

## 2b) Why not “flip only” as the main pitch?

Flip-only can be attractive, but for friends it often feels more like a **business gamble**, with less emotional “I own Italy,” and timelines can slip with permits and trades. Keeping **flip as Plan B** works better: *“If it’s not performing as a rental, we sell.”*

## 3) Downside protection (anti-drama rules)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No surprise capital calls** | Either “no capital calls” or one pre-approved capped call |
| **Budget controls** | Contingency % set; overage beyond threshold requires vote |
| **Exit framework** | Decision gate at 12–18 months; voting thresholds defined |
| **Operator accountability** | Monthly reporting; receipts; transparency |
| **Removal clause** | As defined in governance |
| **One SPV per property** | Deal #2 does not endanger Deal #1 |

**Optional:** Key-man clause (pause spend + vote if operator unavailable); vendor conflict-of-interest disclosure.

---

## 4) Lifestyle use policy

**Goal:** Feature, not liability.

### Two approaches

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **A) Nights per investment (“club nights”)** | e.g. “Each €25k = X nights/year” — needs blackout and priority rules |
| **B) Credit/discount** | Investors book as guests with annual credit or discount on rate / reduced fees |

**Recommendation for Deal #1:** Start with **credit/discount** (less friction). Can upgrade later.

### Non-negotiables

- Booking rules (lead time, blackout, peak)
- Cleaning fee per stay (or from credit)
- Security deposit / damages
- Max consecutive nights; occupancy limits
- Pets policy

## 7) Message script (short pitch)

*“You’ve always wanted Italy. I’m there half the year and I have a real construction/material network. I’m putting together a small group to buy one property, renovate it, and run it as a premium rental. You get real investment upside plus the option to stay there. You don’t have to move there, manage contractors, or learn the system—I’m the bridge. I do the work and I’m incentivized on performance; your money comes back first. At 12–18 months we choose: keep it, sell it, or refinance if it makes sense.”*
