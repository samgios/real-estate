## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research the real estate and short-term rental market in Punta Prosciutto and the wider Salento (Puglia) area, including land and property prices, STR demand and regulation, and the permit process for new build or renovation.

**Context:** We are evaluating Italian residential projects (buy+renovate or land+prefab) for short-term rental, budget under €500k. We have a contact who is building vacation units in Punta Prosciutto, so this area is of interest both as a potential target and as a reference case.

**What we need:**
1. **Location and character** — where exactly is Punta Prosciutto (comune, province)? What is the area known for (beach, tourism, type of visitors)? How does it fit within Salento and Puglia?
2. **Real estate market** — land prices (per m² or per lot) and property prices (e.g. small houses, vacation units) in Punta Prosciutto and nearby (e.g. other Salento coastal or inland areas). Recent trends (e.g. last 2–3 years). Is sub-€500k all-in (land + build or purchase + reno) realistic?
3. **Short-term rental demand** — is STR common here? Seasonality (e.g. summer peak), type of guests, occupancy or rate indicators if available. Any data or reports on STR performance in Salento or Puglia coast?
4. **Regulation** — what are the rules for STR in this area (national + Puglia + local)? Permits or registration required for new build or for converting/renovating for rental?
5. **Permit process** — for building new vacation units (or prefab) on land, what permits are needed? Typical timeline and cost? Any restrictions (e.g. building on coastal zone, size limits)?
6. **Pros and cons for our project** — one short section: why Punta Prosciutto / Salento might be a good fit for a small, value-add STR project, and what the main risks or drawbacks are.

**Output format:** A report with sections: Location & character / Real estate market / STR demand / Regulation / Permit process / Pros & cons. Include a one-page summary: ballpark prices, STR viability (high/medium/low), and "best for" / "watch out for."

**Scope:** Focus on Punta Prosciutto and Salento; use Puglia-wide data where local data is scarce. Prefer recent sources (2023–2025).
