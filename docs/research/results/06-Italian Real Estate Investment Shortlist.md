# **Strategic Asset Allocation in the Italian Residential and Hospitality Markets: A Multi-Regional Feasibility Study for Value-Add and Short-Term Rental Projects (2025–2030)**

## **Executive Summary: Strategic Directives for Capital Allocation**

The Italian real estate landscape in 2025 presents a sophisticated opportunity for North American capital, characterized by a structural shift toward professionalized hospitality and a widening valuation gap between unrenovated historic assets and modernized, energy-efficient residences.1 For a pilot investment project with an all-in budget of €500,000, the primary objective is to identify sub-regions where the acquisition of distressed or under-developed property, combined with strategic renovation or high-efficiency prefabricated builds, yields a competitive advantage in the short-term rental (STR) market.3

The top three recommendations for immediate deployment are:

1. **The Valle d'Itria and Salento, Puglia:** This region remains the most compelling for value-add investors due to its established international brand, the scarcity of renovated heritage typologies like *trulli* and *masserie*, and robust tourism growth that outpaces the national average.5 The region offers a mature rental ecosystem and two international gateways (Bari and Brindisi) that support high-occupancy rates during an extended tourist season.6  
2. **The Val di Noto, Sicily:** Characterized by exceptional value-for-money and a surge in interest from digital nomads and luxury travelers, cities like Ragusa, Modica, and Noto provide entry points as low as €712 to €1,500 per square meter.7 The region is a "hidden gem" transitioning into a "proven" destination, where historical renovation can unlock significant capital appreciation and daily rental rates.9  
3. **Inland Umbria (The Perugia-Todi-Orvieto Axis):** Often referred to as "Tuscany at a discount," Umbria offers the rolling-hill aesthetic desired by high-spending tourists with significantly lower acquisition hurdles and prices averaging €1,173 per square meter.11 Its central location and proximity to Rome make it a resilient market for year-round demand, particularly for high-quality countryside retreats.13

This analysis indicates that a €500,000 all-in budget is highly realistic for these regions, provided the project targets small-to-mid-sized units (60–120 m²) where the renovation cost does not exceed 40–50% of the total investment.8

## **Macro-Economic Environment and Property Market Dynamics (2025–2026)**

The Italian real estate market entered 2025 with a sense of renewed vigor, evidenced by a 50% year-over-year increase in total investment volumes during the first half of the year, reaching €5.2 billion.16 This growth is largely localized within the hospitality and luxury residential segments, reflecting a flight to quality by international investors.16 National average house prices increased by 3.9% in the second quarter of 2025, with transaction volumes rising by over 8%, signaling a healthy but fragmented market.2

### **The North-South Disparity and Yield Compression**

A fundamental characteristic of the Italian market remains the significant price gap between northern industrial hubs and southern Mediterranean regions. Northern regions like Trentino-Alto Adige lead with average prices exceeding €3,200 per square meter, while the deep south, including Calabria and Sicily, offers opportunities below €1,000 per square meter.12 For the STR investor, this disparity provides a strategic choice: higher-certainty, lower-yield "core" assets in the North (e.g., Milan, Lake Como) or higher-yield "value-add" opportunities in the South where the tourism rebound is strongest.5

### **Table 1: National Real Estate Market Metrics by Macro-Area (2025)**

| Macro-Area | Avg. Sale Price (€/m²) | YoY Variation (Sale) | Avg. Rent (€/m²/mo) | YoY Variation (Rent) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Northern Italy | €2,176 – €3,701 | \+4.6% to \+7.0% | €12.16 – €18.49 | \+4.5% |
| Central Italy | €1,173 – €2,619 | \+2.6% to \+3.8% | €8.47 – €16.19 | \+3.5% |
| Southern Italy | €912 – €1,953 | \+0.7% to \+3.6% | €6.70 – €10.75 | \+2.0% |
| **National Average** | **€2,113 – €2,150** | **\+2.73% to \+3.9%** | **€14.22** | **\+4.6%** |

The evidence suggests that price growth is currently fueled by the existing housing stock, which rose by 4.5% year-on-year, compared to a modest 1.1% increase for new builds.2 This implies that the market places a premium on established locations and historic character over modern volume, a critical insight for renovation-focused projects.

## **The Regulatory Framework for Short-Term Rentals (STR)**

The legal landscape for short-term rentals in Italy has undergone its most dramatic shift in a decade. The central government introduced the *Codice Identificativo Nazionale* (CIN) to professionalize the sector and ensure safety compliance.23

### **Compliance as a Revenue Driver**

While new regulations—including the mandatory installation of fire extinguishers, gas detectors, and carbon monoxide sensors—increase upfront costs, they have paradoxically improved market performance.23 Data from 2025 shows that RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) for compliant properties jumped by up to 20% in peak months like October.23 Guests demonstrate a willingness to pay higher rates for legally verified and safer accommodations, effectively squeezing out informal, low-quality competition.23

### **Key STR Regulations for 2025:**

* **National Identification Code (CIN):** Mandatory for all listings on platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com. Non-compliance results in significant fines and platform removal.23  
* **Taxation:** A flat-rate tax (*cedolare secca*) of 26% applies to STR income, though it can be reduced to 21% for a single property if managed personally rather than as a business entity.24  
* **Check-in Protocols:** A 2024 ban on remote self-check-in (key boxes) was partially eased by a May 2025 court ruling, allowing remote check-ins provided that smart locks or biometric tools are used for identity verification.23  
* **Local Caps:** Cities like Florence and Venice have implemented freezes or caps on new STR licenses in UNESCO-protected historic centers, making nearby suburban or secondary-city investments more attractive.23

## **Value-Add Logistics: Renovation and Prefabricated Construction**

Success in a €500,000 pilot deal depends on rigorous cost control and a nuanced understanding of Italian construction methodology. Renovation is the most common path to value creation, but prefabricated construction is gaining traction as a high-speed, cost-predictable alternative.25

### **Renovation Cost Benchmarks (2025)**

The average cost for residential renovation varies between €400 and €1,500 per square meter, depending on the scope and the quality of finishes.15 For a structural overhaul—including new plumbing, high-efficiency heating (e.g., underfloor systems), and updated electrical systems—investors should budget between €1,000 and €1,350 per square meter.15

### **Table 2: Estimated Renovation Component Costs (2025)**

| Category | Cost Range | Unit | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Roofing (Terracotta/Slate) | €125 – €200 | per m² | Includes removal, labor, and insulation 28 |
| Flooring (Parquet/Tiles) | €40 – €120 | per m² | Varies by material quality 28 |
| Electrical Rewiring | €35 – €45 | per m² | Complete modernization to code 28 |
| Bathroom Renovation | €3,000 – €10,000 | per unit | Includes systems and sanitary ware 28 |
| Kitchen Installation | €500 – €1,000 | per m² | Excludes high-end appliances 28 |
| Interior Painting | €5 – €30 | per m² | Includes wall preparation 28 |

The presence of a local operator for six months a year is a critical advantage for managing these works, as it allows for the "unannounced" site visits necessary to ensure contractor accountability and timeline adherence.15

### **The Prefabricated and Modular Alternative**

Prefabricated housing in Italy is no longer a niche market. Driven by labor shortages in traditional masonry and a demand for speed, the market is projected to grow at over 5% CAGR through 2035\.31 For the North American investor, this model offers "total cost predictability".25

Modular homes can be completed in under 60–90 days once the foundation (slab) is poured.33

* **Entry-level modular:** €1,200 – €1,800 per m².  
* **Mid-range modular:** €1,800 – €2,500 per m².  
* **Premium/Eco-luxe:** €2,500 – €3,500+ per m².  
* **Foundations/Connections:** Add €200 – €400 per m².26

While land prices for new builds are high in the North, regions like Abruzzo and Puglia offer building plots (*terreno edificabile*) that make a land-plus-prefab project achievable under €500,000.35

## **Short-Term Rental Demand and Tourism Indicators (2024–2025)**

Italy remains the world's leading tourism destination in terms of overnight stays, with 127 million guest nights in 2024—a 19% jump from the previous year.4 The "Easter effect" and seasonal shifts are expanding the traditional summer window into the "shoulder months" of April, September, and October, which saw occupancy growth of up to 3% in 2025\.23

### **Demand Hotspots:**

* **Urban Hubs:** Rome (15.7 million guest nights), Milan, and Florence lead the surge in international arrivals.4  
* **Resort Areas:** Lake Como, Sicily, and Forte dei Marmi account for nearly 39% of total hospitality investment.4  
* **Emerging Coastal:** Liguria, Sardinia, and Puglia are seeing a rise in demand from digital nomads, who prioritize high-speed internet and longer stays over traditional weekend tourism.10

For a pilot deal, focusing on "proven" areas with established tourism infrastructure ensures high initial occupancy, while "emerging" areas offer the possibility of higher yield and long-term capital gains.2

## **SHORTLIST: TOP 8 REGIONS FOR INVESTMENT UNDER €500K**

### **1\. Salento and Valle d'Itria, Puglia**

**Rank: \#1 (Best for Proven STR Demand and High-Value Typologies)**

Puglia has transitioned from a rustic "insider tip" to a global powerhouse. The regional average price of €1,437 per square meter hides a sharp divergence between the high-end Valle d'Itria towns and the affordable Salento coast.6 For a €500,000 project, the strategy is the restoration of *trulli* or *lamie* (traditional stone houses) or the acquisition of a villa in the Salento countryside near Lecce.6

* **Financials:** Acquisition of an unrenovated stone shell (€150k–€200k) \+ full modernization (€200k–€250k) \= €400k–€450k total.6  
* **STR Demand:** Very strong. Puglia recorded a sharp increase in holiday property demand, leading to rental bottlenecks in towns like Polignano a Mare and Monopoli.39 Seasonality is long (May to October), supported by two international airports.6  
* **Permit/Process:** Moderate. The local *geometra* network is experienced with international buyers, but heritage rules (*vincoli*) in historic centers can delay structural works.6  
* **Pros:** High liquidity; established tourism managers; exceptional international brand.5  
* **Cons:** Increasing competition; some sub-areas (e.g., Ostuni) are approaching a price ceiling.6

### **2\. Val di Noto and Eastern Sicily**

**Rank: \#2 (Best for Capital Appreciation and Cultural Lifestyle)**

Eastern Sicily offers a unique "Renaissance" feel. The Baroque towns of Noto, Ragusa, and Modica have become magnets for sophisticated travelers. Most affordable provincial capitals like Ragusa (€712/m²) offer incredible entry points for city-center apartments.7

* **Financials:** Renovated period properties in Syracuse/Noto range from €2,000–€4,500/m², making a 100 m² high-end unit achievable for €400k all-in.9  
* **STR Demand:** High and growing. Demand is split between cultural tourism and seaside visitors. Luxury villa values in Castellammare del Golfo can reach €5,000/m², but "distressed" assets in Mazara del Vallo start from €400/m².10  
* **Permit/Process:** Moderate. Local bureaucracy is famously complex, but the abundance of "1-euro" house programs in the region has created streamlined pathways for some renovation projects.30  
* **Pros:** UNESCO heritage; year-round tourism; significant price growth potential in the "luxury authentic" segment.3  
* **Cons:** Logistics (island isolation); infrastructure can be inconsistent in rural areas.11

### **3\. Inland Umbria (Perugia, Orvieto, Todi)**

**Rank: \#3 (Best for Stable Returns and Tuscan-Adjacent Aesthetic)**

Umbria is the "Green Heart of Italy," offering rolling hills, olive groves, and medieval hilltop villages without the "Tuscan tax".11 Average prices are €1,173/m², providing ample room for a high-end renovation.12

* **Financials:** A large stone townhouse or portion of a farmhouse can be acquired for €180k–€250k, with €200k allocated for premium "energy-class-A" renovation.14  
* **STR Demand:** Strong domestic and international demand. Proximity to Rome (under 2 hours) ensures a steady weekend market.14 Perugia and Assisi attract religious and cultural pilgrims year-round.42  
* **Permit/Process:** Relatively straightforward compared to the South. The region has a developed professional sector used to serving Northern European and American expats.13  
* **Pros:** Scenic beauty; central location; lower density of listings than Tuscany.11  
* **Cons:** No sea access; winter demand is lower outside of major cities.5

### **4\. The Adriatic Coast and Inland Abruzzo**

**Rank: \#4 (Best for New-Build Potential and Adventure Tourism)**

Abruzzo is one of Italy's best-kept secrets, offering a "dual-season" market where you can ski in the morning and be at the beach in the afternoon.11 Prices average €1,379/m², with significant bargains available in the province of Chieti (€1,158/m²).43

* **Financials:** Building land for a 100 m² villa can be found for €30k–€50k near the coast in Torino di Sangro.36 A land \+ premium prefab project is highly feasible under €350k.  
* **STR Demand:** Strong during the summer for Adriatic beaches (Pescara, Vasto) and winter for ski resorts (Roccaraso). Pineto and Vasto show occupancy rates between 32% and 39% for standard listings.44  
* **Permit/Process:** Very manageable. Towns like Penne have launched aggressive programs to attract buyers, often requiring no security deposit and providing a local network of architects.30  
* **Pros:** Incredible nature; Rome is only 2 hours away; lowest cost-per-square-meter for coastal access in Central Italy.5  
* **Cons:** Brand recognition is still trailing Puglia; tourism is more domestic-focused for now.5

### **5\. Riviera di Ponente, Western Liguria**

**Rank: \#5 (Best for Micro-Climate and Proximity to France)**

The Western Ligurian coast (Imperia and Savona) is an "insider tip" for 2025\. It is significantly cheaper than the Riviera di Levante (Eastern Liguria) but offers the same Mediterranean glamour and proximity to the French Riviera.39

* **Financials:** Average prices are high (€2,500–€3,000/m²), but a €500k budget can secure a premium 60–80 m² sea-view apartment or a small house in the historic center of Sanremo or Bordighera.39  
* **STR Demand:** Very High. The season runs from March to October. High accessibility from Nice airport and the French border attracts a wealthy international demographic.39  
* **Permit/Process:** Challenging. Coastal regulations and strict urban planning in historic towns make structural changes slow and expensive.9  
* **Pros:** Crisis-proof market; elite reputation; best climate in Northern Italy.39  
* **Cons:** Higher entry point; limited land for new builds; high transaction taxes for non-residents.5

### **6\. Southern Maremma and Inland Tuscany (Grosseto, Arezzo)**

**Rank: \#6 (Best for Brand Resilience and Safe-Haven Capital)**

Tuscany remains the most requested region by North American buyers (18% of all inquiries).13 While the "Golden Triangle" is overpriced, the Maremma coast and the Arezzo countryside offer relative value.17

* **Financials:** Arezzo province averages €1,684/m².7 A €500k budget allows for a 3-bedroom villa or a renovated farmhouse portion in towns like Cortona.14  
* **STR Demand:** The most resilient in Italy. High-spending tourists prioritize Tuscany for its food, wine, and cultural "legacy".17  
* **Permit/Process:** Difficult. The *Vincolo Paesaggistico* (landscape protection) is very strict, requiring extra commissions and extending review times to 9+ months for major works.28  
* **Pros:** Unmatched global recognition; high liquidity for resale; professional English-speaking support.13  
* **Cons:** Saturated market; high taxes and maintenance costs.5

### **7\. Termoli and the Molise Coast**

**Rank: \#7 (Best Hidden Gem for High-Risk, High-Reward Growth)**

Molise is often described as "the region that doesn't exist," but its coastal capital, Termoli, is seeing a surge in interest. It is currently the most affordable region for rentals and one of the lowest for sales (€1,028/m²).12

* **Financials:** Seafront properties in Termoli average €3,000/m², but "second-row" properties requiring renovation are available for significantly less.10 A €500k budget could potentially secure two smaller units.  
* **STR Demand:** Emerging. Primarily domestic, but international interest rose by 4.2% in 2025\.10 Termoli acts as a gateway to the Tremiti Islands, a major Adriatic draw.  
* **Permit/Process:** Easier than many neighboring regions due to a local government desperate for investment.10  
* **Pros:** Ground-floor entry; lowest overall costs; beautiful, uncrowded beaches.10  
* **Cons:** Limited infrastructure; lower occupancy during the winter; difficult for non-Italian speakers.5

### **8\. The Cedar Coast, Calabria**

**Rank: \#8 (Best for Low Entry Cost and Budget Volume)**

Calabria is Italy’s most affordable region, with an average price of €958 per square meter.11 For the investor focused on volume or a "bare-bones" seaside project, towns like Scalea and Tropea offer unmatched beach proximity.10

* **Financials:** Sea-view apartments can be acquired for as little as €67,000.11 A €500k budget could renovate an entire small building of 4–6 units.  
* **STR Demand:** Highly seasonal. August is overcrowded, but June and July are growing.10 Tropea is a major "anchor" for international visitors.11  
* **Permit/Process:** Variable. Generally less "digital" than the North, requiring on-ground presence to push through local municipal offices.5  
* **Pros:** Extremely low acquisition cost; stunning natural scenery; growing interest from the Eastern European and digital nomad markets.10  
* **Cons:** Weaker local economy; high youth unemployment; infrastructure needs modernization.20

## **Permit and Process Analysis: A Professional Roadmap**

For the value-add investor, the speed of bureaucratic approval is the ultimate variable in ROI. The Italian system differentiates between "maintenance" and "structural" work, which determines the permitting pathway.23

### **The CILA/SCIA/PdC Hierarchy**

1. **CILA (Certified Notice of Commencement of Works):** Mandatory for "extraordinary maintenance" that does not change the building's structure or volume (e.g., reconfiguring non-load-bearing walls, moving a bathroom).23  
   * **Feasibility:** High. Work can begin immediately after filing.  
   * **Cost:** Professional fees of €2,000–€5,000 for the geometra/architect.15  
2. **SCIA (Certified Notification of Start of Activity):** Required for structural modifications (e.g., roof replacement, new window openings, foundation work).23  
   * **Feasibility:** Moderate. Work can start immediately, but the municipality has 30 days to object or stop works.46 It shifts all responsibility to the signing professional.46  
3. **Permesso di Costruire (PdC):** Required for new builds or major expansions.28  
   * **Feasibility:** Low for a pilot project. Review times are 3 to 9 months, and work can only start after explicit approval.46

### **Regional Administrative Efficiency**

For a Canadian investor, **Abruzzo and Sicily** currently offer the most "pro-active" municipal environments due to their aggressive campaigns to attract foreign capital through €1 houses and simplified urban planning initiatives.30 In contrast, **Tuscany and Liguria** are highly bureaucratic, with extra layers of historical and environmental review that can add 6–12 months to any structural project.28

## **Hidden Gems and Forward-Looking "Alpha" (2026–2030)**

### **The "Olympic Shadow": Belluno and the Veneto Hinterland**

While Cortina d'Ampezzo is the focus for the 2026 Winter Olympics, prices there are prohibitive. However, the province of **Belluno** offers alpine scenery and strong winter STR potential at a fraction of the cost.13 Investors can capitalize on the post-Games infrastructure improvements and a global branding boost for the entire Dolomites region.24

### **The Digital Nomad Corridor: Trapani and Mazara del Vallo**

Western Sicily is seeing a rise in "long-stay" tourism. Digital nomads are attracted to the combination of low cost-of-living and high-speed satellite internet.3 Properties needing renovation in Mazara del Vallo start at €400 per square meter, making this an ideal "emerging" market for a value-add STR project targeting the remote work demographic.10

### **Sustainable Retrofitting as a Competitive Advantage**

By 2025, higher energy-rated homes (Class A or B) recorded significantly stronger price growth than lower-rated properties. The premium for energy-efficient homes has reached roughly 53.9%.1 Projects that prioritize thermal insulation (*cappotto termico*), heat pumps, and solar integration will not only benefit from tax deductions but also command higher nightly rates from eco-conscious travelers.1

## **STRATEGIC PROFILES: ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARIES**

* **Puglia (Salento/Valle d'Itria):** This region fits the profile perfectly by offering iconic architecture (*trulli*) that commands a massive premium once renovated to high-end standards. The main risk is the potential for overcrowding in hotspots like Ostuni, which may lead to stricter local rental caps in the future. **Best for:** Luxury heritage STR with high international visibility.  
* **Eastern Sicily (Val di Noto):** It offers some of the best entry prices for urban apartments in beautiful Baroque cities, where a high-end interior renovation can triple the property's rental value. The primary risk is the slower pace of local logistics and infrastructure upgrades compared to the mainland. **Best for:** Cultural STR and digital nomad long-stays.  
* **Inland Umbria:** A robust choice for those seeking "Tuscan vibes" with less competition and more manageable purchase prices, making the €500k budget go much further. The main risk is the lack of coastal draw, which makes the product more dependent on specialized agritourism or slow-travel marketing. **Best for:** High-quality countryside retreats and authentic village life.  
* **Abruzzo (Coast & Mountains):** Abruzzo provides a versatile dual-season market and an extremely welcoming environment for new builds, including prefabricated projects. The primary risk is the lower international "brand recognition" compared to Puglia or Tuscany, requiring a more proactive marketing approach. **Best for:** Value-add land \+ prefab projects and adventure-seeking guests.  
* **Western Liguria (Riviera di Ponente):** This region acts as a "safe haven" market with high-net-worth rental demand from nearby France and Northern Italy. The main risk is the high barrier to structural change due to strict coastal and historic building codes. **Best for:** High-yield beachfront apartments with resilient capital value.  
* **Tuscany (Arezzo/Maremma):** Offers the security of the world's most famous regional real estate brand, ensuring high occupancy and steady appreciation. The main risk is the extreme bureaucratic complexity and high professional fees for any renovation work. **Best for:** Conservative capital preservation and elite-tier hospitality.  
* **Molise (Termoli):** The ultimate "first-mover" advantage play, where acquisition costs are among the lowest in the country for seaside property. The primary risk is low liquidity and a smaller pool of potential buyers if a quick exit is required. **Best for:** Ground-floor coastal growth and high-yield multi-unit projects.  
* **Calabria (Cedar Coast):** Unbeatable for beachfront entry prices, allowing an investor to build a portfolio of several units for the price of a single apartment in Milan. The main risk is the weaker local economy and highly seasonal demand that drops sharply outside of the July-August window. **Best for:** Budget-conscious vacation rentals and low-entry barrier projects.

## **STRATEGIC COMPARISON TABLE: INVESTMENT FEASIBILITY BY REGION (2025)**

| Region / Area | €500k All-in Feasible? | STR Demand Indicator | Value-Add / Build Ease | Main Investment Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Puglia (Salento)** | Yes (High-End Finish) | Very High (Int'l) | Moderate (Experienced) | Market Saturation in Hubs |
| **Sicily (Val di Noto)** | Yes (Multiple Units) | High (Culture/Nomad) | Moderate (Bureaucracy) | Structural/Logistics Gaps |
| **Umbria (Inland)** | Yes (Substantial) | High (Slow Travel) | High (Expat-Ready) | Seasonality (Off-Coast) |
| **Abruzzo (Coastal)** | Yes (Land \+ Prefab) | Moderate (Emerging) | High (Supportive Towns) | Low Brand Awareness |
| **W. Liguria (Imperia)** | Yes (Compact Unit) | Very High (Proximity) | Low (Strict Regs) | High Entry Cost per m² |
| **Tuscany (Inland)** | Yes (Secondary Areas) | Very High (Proven) | Very Low (High Regs) | Saturated Listing Market |
| **Molise (Termoli)** | Yes (Volume Play) | Emerging (Domestic) | High (Under-the-Radar) | Low Liquidity/Resale |
| **Calabria (Tropea)** | Yes (Portfolio) | Moderate (Seasonal) | High (Flexible) | Weaker Local Economy |

## **Strategic Conclusions and Final Recommendations**

The Italian property market of 2025 is no longer a "buyer's market" in the traditional sense of universal bargains; instead, it is a highly segmented market where alpha is generated through meticulous sub-area selection and technical execution.1 For the Canadian investment profile, the presence of an on-ground operator for half the year is the single most important mitigator of "Italian risk," particularly regarding contractor oversight and navigating the CILA/SCIA permit landscape.15

**Deployment Recommendation:**

1. **Primary Target:** Puglia (Valle d'Itria) for a "high-character" restoration. The demand for authentic *trulli* or stone *masseria* units remains unsatisfied, particularly in the €400k–€600k resale bracket, providing a clear exit strategy.6  
2. **Secondary Target:** Sicily (Val di Noto) for an urban Baroque apartment renovation. The low cost-per-square-meter in cities like Ragusa allows for a "premium" finish that dominates the local STR market while maintaining a low total cost basis.7  
3. **Building Strategy:** Prioritize "Energy Class A" certifications. The 53.9% valuation premium for efficient homes is a structural shift that will protect the investment against future EU building regulations and increase appeal to high-end tenants.1

By focusing on these "proven-emerging" regions and utilizing the 36–50% renovation tax bonuses available in 2025, the pilot deal can achieve both an attractive immediate yield (estimated 6–10% gross) and a significant capital uplift upon completion.41
