# Italy Home Club — Deal #1 | Deal Sheet (1 page)

**Project:** Italy Residential SPV — Pilot Deal  
**Vehicle:** One Italian S.r.l. (SPV) per property  
**Target budget:** < €500k all-in  

**Positioning:** *Lifestyle-first asset, value-add, flexible exit*

---

## Opportunity

**Buy → Renovate → Operate as premium short-term rental (or hybrid) → Decide at 12–24 months:** Keep / Sell / Refinance. Flip is Plan B (“if it’s not performing as a rental, we sell”). Operator on the ground ~6 months/year + local construction and materials network.

## Productized concept

| Element | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Properties | 1 |
| Investors | 6–10 max (friends) |
| Min ticket | €25k–€50k |
| Hold | 18–36 months |
| Lifestyle use | e.g. each €25k = 3–5 nights/year (blackout applies) |
| Operator | Fee + carry |

## Structure

- **1 SPV (S.r.l.) per property** — risk isolation, scalable to Deal #2, #3
- **Canadian friends = LPs** (capital); **You = GP/Operator** (sourcing, execution, reporting)

## Returns

- **Value creation:** Renovation + repositioning
- **Income:** Premium STR (or hybrid) during hold
- **Waterfall:** Return of capital → preferred return (e.g. 6–10% annual) → carry (e.g. 20–30% to operator)

## Investor experience

- Slice of an Italian home; no management (“I’m the bridge”)
- Optional lifestyle use (stays/credits) under clear rules
- Defined decision moment (12–24 months); no surprise capital calls; max budget + contingency + stop-loss
