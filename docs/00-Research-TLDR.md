# Research TLDR — Italy Deal #1 (Feb 2026)

One-page summary of the 10 research topics: what we learned, opportunities, no-gos, and what’s new.

## In one sentence

**A sub-€500k Italian STR/value-add deal is feasible for Canadian investors** in target regions (Puglia/Salento, Sicily Val di Noto, Umbria) via an Italian S.r.l., **only in comuni &lt;10k inhabitants** (reciprocity), with **buy + renovate** as the default path; **land + prefab in coastal park areas (e.g. Punta Prosciutto) is a no-go** unless the plot already has a building permit. Funding via specialist FX (not Big 5), notary escrow, and a forward contract for the closing balance; full Italian + Canadian compliance (CIN, STR insurance, S.r.l. revenue bar, T1134/T1135, ACB) is non-negotiable.

## New findings (delta)

| Area | Finding |
|------|--------|
| **Reciprocity** | Canada’s foreign-buyer ban → Italy limits Canadians to **comuni &lt;10k** (not major cities). Notary checks before deed; **confirm exact comune with notary before caparra**. S.r.l. bypasses “individual” block but not the look-through. |
| **S.r.l. revenue bar** | **4.75% of property value per year** (e.g. STR income) or “società di comodo”: 34.5% IRES, no cost deductions, no VAT recovery. Plan rental from day one. |
| **Canadian tax (S.r.l.)** | FAPI on rental (accrual in Canada); **RTF 1.9** for individuals → residual Canadian tax; **HoldCo (RTF 4.0)** usually no extra Canadian tax. **T1134** for S.r.l. (≥1%/10% group); **T1135** for other foreign property &gt;$100k. Quebec **TP-1079** from 2025. |
| **Punta Prosciutto / Salento** | **Fixed prefab on agricultural land in the park = not permitted.** Building land scarce (€100–320/m²). Best path: **buy existing unrenovated 1970s–80s villa** (secondary rows); land+prefab only if **permesso già rilasciato**. |
| **FX** | Big 5 markup **$15–25k** on ~€400k vs specialist **$3–6k**. **IBKR not** for one-off “convert and withdraw”—ToS risk. **Bonifico parlante** for Italian reno tax credits → need **Italian bank** (Wise/FX specialists usually don’t support). |
| **Insurance** | **Primary Italian STR policy** required (guest damage, loss of income, RCT); platform cover is secondary. **RC Postuma (decennial)** for heavy reno/new build; principal-led CAR recommended. |
| **Permits** | Coastal/park: PdC **3–9 months** (Soprintendenza). CILA/SCIA for reno (start immediately, 30-day objection for SCIA). **Sanatoria** if cadastral issues: 2–4 months. |
| **Purchase** | S.r.l. **9% on actual price** (no prezzo-valore); **total closing 15–22%**. **Notary escrow** (Deposito del Prezzo) for final balance = traceability + security. **4–6 months** to rogito; corporate bank KYC main delay. |

## Opportunities

| Opportunity | How |
|-------------|-----|
| **Mini PIA Turismo (Puglia, to 2027)** | **40–50%** non-repayable grant on purchase + reno + furnishing; 25% equity + 75% bank, grant in year 2. De-seasonalization and energy efficiency prioritized. |
| **Bonus Ristrutturazione** | **36%** tax deduction up to €96k (second homes); 10-year spread. Requires **bonifico parlante** from Italian account. |
| **Energy class** | Class A/B premium ~**54%** (2025); insulation, heat pumps, solar improve yield and resale. |
| **Top regions** | **Puglia (Valle d’Itria/Salento)** #1—trulli/masserie, two airports, May–Oct; **Sicily Val di Noto** best €/m²; **Umbria** “Tuscany at a discount,” year-round. Abruzzo: land+prefab viable (€30–50k land), dual-season. |
| **FX and hedging** | **Wise** for proposta/caparra; **MTFX/OFX** for main + closing; **forward** if compromesso→rogito &gt;60 days (5% move ≈ $30k on €400k). |
| **Canadian structure** | **HoldCo → S.r.l.** best FAPI outcome (RTF 4.0); Italian co-admin / board in Italy to avoid S.r.l. deemed Canadian resident. |
| **STR compliance** | CIN + safety (extinguishers, detectors) → **RevPAR +20%** in some data; compliant = trust and platform security. |

## No-gos and red lines

| No-go | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Major Italian cities (e.g. Florence, Rome, Milan)** | Reciprocity: Canadians restricted to comuni &lt;10k; notary will void deed if not satisfied. |
| **Land + prefab in Punta Prosciutto / park without permit** | Agricultural land in park effectively non-buildable; fixed prefab on agric = not permitted. Only with **permesso già rilasciato** or in non-park building zones. |
| **Relying on Big 5 for main EUR transfer** | ~$15–25k extra cost vs specialist on €400k; intermediary deductions can cause shortfalls at notary. |
| **Using IBKR only to convert CAD→EUR and withdraw** | Breach of ToS; account review/closure risk. |
| **S.r.l. with no/minimal rental income** | &lt;4.75% of value/year → società di comodo → 34.5% IRES, no deductions. |
| **Signing compromesso before reciprocity check** | Confirm with notary for **exact comune** before caparra; deed void if reciprocity not met. |
| **Assuming Wise covers reno tax credits** | Bonifico parlante not supported; need Italian bank for Bonus Ristrutturazione. |
| **STR without CIN + RCT insurance** | Mandatory from 2025; listings removed without CIN; fines €800–€8k+; RC required for SCIA. |
| **Skipping geometra (conformità)** | Cadastral/planning mismatches → sanatoria 2–4 months or blocked sale; ensure “mutuabile” if using bank. |
| **Ignoring T1134/T1135** | T1134 for S.r.l. (deadline 10 months post year-end); T1135 if other foreign property &gt;$100k; Quebec TP-1079 from 2025. Penalties material. |

## What to do next (from research)

1. **Target:** Confirm **comune** population (&lt;10k) and notary reciprocity for any shortlisted location (Puglia/Sicily/Umbria) before any offer.
2. **Path:** Prefer **buy existing + renovate** (especially in Salento/Punta Prosciutto); only pursue land+prefab where building land is confirmed and permit path is clear (e.g. Abruzzo).
3. **Money:** Line up **MTFX or OFX**; use **notary escrow** for closing; **forward** once compromesso is signed if rogito &gt;60 days out.
4. **Structure:** Decide S.r.l. only vs HoldCo→S.r.l. with Canadian tax advisor (FAPI, T1134, residency); plan **≥4.75%** revenue from STR from year one.
5. **Compliance:** CIN + safety + RCT + STR policy; Italian bank if claiming reno credits; **BoC rate + invoice per payment** for ACB (and T1135 if applicable).
6. **Budget:** €500k all-in → plan **~€300–350k liquid** (equity + costs + valuation gap + S.r.l. setup); **16–18%** acquisition cost; **€500–1k/year** STR insurance.
