## Prompt (copy from here)

**Task:** Research the practical options for Canadian investors to fund and manage foreign exchange (CAD to EUR) exposure for a small Italian real estate project—total size under €500k.

**Context:** Investors are Canadian residents; the asset and most costs (purchase, renovation, operations) are in EUR. We do not want to over-engineer for Deal #1, but we need to know: how to get EUR to Italy, at what cost, and whether any simple hedging or documentation is advisable for tax and reporting.

**What we need:**
1. **Transfer options** — how can Canadians send larger sums (e.g. €50k–€500k) to Italy (or to an Italian bank account)? Options: bank wire (SWIFT), specialized FX/transfer providers (e.g. Wise, OFX, Interactive Brokers, others). For each: typical cost (spread, fees), speed, limits, and any quirks (e.g. need to show source of funds).
2. **Conversion best practices** — when to convert (lump sum vs staged)? Spot vs forward for this size? Any advantage to using a dedicated FX provider vs bank for amounts in this range?
3. **Hedging** — is hedging (e.g. forward contract) typically used for a one-off project of this size (under €500k)? Pros and cons. If yes, what products or providers are accessible to Canadian individuals or small entities?
4. **Documentation and reporting** — what should we document for tax and compliance (Canada and Italy)? Proof of source of funds, exchange rate used for conversion, timing of transfers. Any CRA or Italian requirements that affect how we move and record the money?
5. **Practical takeaways** — 3–5 clear recommendations for our situation: e.g. "use X for transfers," "avoid Y," "document Z."

**Output format:** A report with sections: Transfer options (with comparison table if possible) / Conversion / Hedging / Documentation / Takeaways. Include a one-page summary: recommended transfer approach, approximate total cost for moving €400k from CAD, and "do we need to hedge?" (yes/no with short reason).

**Scope:** Canadian residents sending CAD and converting to EUR for use in Italy. No need to cover Italian tax on the property itself (that's a separate topic). Focus on practical, actionable information.
