# 7. Backlog and next steps

## 1) Open decisions (backlog)

1. **Supplier contributions:** Invoice vs discount vs deferred payment vs upside
2. **Operator remuneration:** Full model (fee + success fee + carry); conditions
3. **Waterfall for A and C:** Final numbers (even if simplified)
4. **Governance:** Quorum, vote thresholds, signatories
5. **Debt policy:** When to use debt; criteria “if debt, then…”
6. **Structure validation:** S.r.l. with Avvocato/Commercialista + Canada implications

## 2) Open questions (current)

- Final lifestyle policy: nights vs credits
- Preferred return target (if any)
- Capital call stance: none vs capped
- Voting thresholds
- Who is day-to-day operator when Sam is in Canada

## 3) Next steps (ready to execute)

### Step 1 — Investor-ready pack

- 1-page Deal Sheet (from this documentation)
- Simple model: 3 scenarios (flip / STR / hybrid)
- Draft Term Sheet + Club Rules annex

### Step 2 — Structure-only calls

- Italy: Avvocato + Commercialista
- Canada: Tax advisor

### Step 3 — Deal #1 pipeline

- Shortlist of 5–10 (or 10–20) candidate properties
- Pre-screen and quick underwriting
- Top 3 → full diligence

### Step 4 — Standard SPV template

- Create reusable “one SPV per property” package: documents, registers, rules
