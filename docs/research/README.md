# Research — Deep research topics, prompts & results

Central place for deep research (e.g. Gemini Deep Research) on the Italy Residential SPV project.

| What | Where |
|------|--------|
| **Topics** | [topics.md](topics.md) — list of research topics, prompts, and run tracker |
| **Prompts** | [prompts/](prompts/) — one file per topic, numbered 01–10 to match topic order |
| **Results** | [results/](results/) — saved reports, numbered 01–10 to match topic (e.g. 01 = prefab) |

## Quick links

- **[Topics & tracker](topics.md)** — pick a topic, copy its prompt, run research, tick the box, save the result under `results/`.
- **Prompts** — one file per topic, 01–10 (e.g. `prompts/01-prefab-manufacturers.md`, `prompts/02-italian-mortgages-non-resident-spv.md`).
- **Results** — name results to match the topic number (e.g. `results/01-Prefab Home Manufacturers For Italy.md` for topic 1).

## Workflow

1. Open [topics.md](topics.md) and choose a topic.
2. Open the linked prompt in [prompts/](prompts/), copy the “Prompt (copy from here)” block.
3. Run your deep-research tool; save the report in [results/](results/) with a clear filename.
4. In topics.md, tick the Run box, add date and notes, and set **Result:** to the new file.
5. Feed the result back to update project docs (e.g. operations, finance, compliance).
