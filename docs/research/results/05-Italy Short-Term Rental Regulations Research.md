# **Strategic Governance and Operational Compliance in the Italian Short-Term Rental Market: A Comprehensive Multi-Tiered Analysis of National and Regional Frameworks (2024–2026)**

The Italian short-term rental sector, historically governed by a fragmented collection of civil codes, regional laws, and municipal ordinances, has entered a period of unprecedented centralization and professionalization. This transition is driven by the state's dual objectives of curbing tax evasion and ensuring a standardized level of safety and quality for the burgeoning tourism industry. For investors seeking to deploy capital into premium residential assets—particularly in high-yield regions such as Puglia, Sicily, and Sardinia—the regulatory environment for 2024 and 2025 demands a sophisticated understanding of how national mandates intersect with local administrative requirements. The shift from an "informal" sharing economy to a "regulated" hospitality asset class is codified in the introduction of the *Codice Identificativo Nazionale* (CIN), the implementation of the *Banca Dati Nazionale delle Strutture Ricettive* (BDSR), and the calibration of fiscal burdens based on the scale of operation.1

## **The National Infrastructure: Centralization and the CIN Mandate**

The fundamental pillar of the contemporary Italian short-term rental (*affitti brevi*) framework is the movement toward a unified national registry. Until recently, property owners were subject primarily to regional identification systems, which varied significantly in their requirements and digital accessibility. However, Article 13-ter of Decree-Law 145/2023, subsequently refined by the 2024 and 2025 Budget Laws, established the CIN as a mandatory requirement for every unit leased for tourist purposes or for periods under 30 days.1

### **The Implementation and Timeline of the BDSR**

The Ministry of Tourism oversees the BDSR, a national database that aggregates property data across all regions and autonomous provinces. The CIN serves as a digital "license plate" that ensures transparency across online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. The timeline for compliance has been strictly defined: the full activation of the national system was set for late 2024, with enforcement and the application of heavy sanctions beginning on January 1, 2025\.1 For properties located in regions that already utilize a regional code (CIR), the national system allows for a transition period. Specifically, once a regional code is obtained, the owner has a 10-day window to secure the corresponding CIN from the national portal.4 If a region does not have an existing coding system, owners must apply directly to the BDSR using their digital identity (SPID or CIE).4

| National Compliance Milestone | Effective Date | Legal Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Full CIN Obligation | January 1, 2025 | D.L. 145/2023; D.M. 16726/2024 1 |
| Mandatory Safety Self-Certification | November 2, 2024 | Art. 13-ter, c. 7, D.L. 145/2023 4 |
| Professional Presumption (4+ Units) | January 1, 2021 | L. 178/2020; L. 213/2023 2 |
| Platform Withholding Obligation | Tax Year 2024 | EU Directive 2021/514 (DAC7) 2 |

The process for obtaining the CIN involves an explicit declaration of compliance with fire safety and gas detection standards. The digital portal cross-references cadastral data with the property’s fiscal history, effectively ending the era of "unmapped" rentals. For premium operators, the acquisition of the CIN is not merely a bureaucratic hurdle but a prerequisite for digital visibility, as platforms are now legally obligated to remove any listing that fails to display a valid national code.2

### **The Standardized National Safety Mandate**

A transformative element of the new national framework is the extension of safety requirements, previously reserved for hotel-like structures, to all residential units used for short-term rentals. Regardless of whether a property is managed as a private individual or an enterprise, it must now meet specific technical standards regarding fire prevention and gas monitoring.1

Functional combustible gas detectors and carbon monoxide (CO) detectors must be installed in all units. These devices are particularly mandatory in areas posing specific risks, such as kitchens or rooms housing boilers and heaters.1 Furthermore, every property must be equipped with portable fire extinguishers. The law specifies that there must be at least one extinguisher per floor and a minimum of one extinguisher for every 200 square meters of surface area. These extinguishers must be placed in visible and easily accessible locations, typically along escape routes or near exits.1

| Safety Equipment Requirement | Specification/Standard | Operational Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Portable Fire Extinguishers | 1 per floor / 1 per 200 sqm | Visible near exits and high-risk areas 4 |
| Gas Detectors (Combustible) | Mandatory for all units | Proximity to gas sources (stoves, boilers) 1 |
| CO Detectors | Mandatory for all units | Near heating systems and boilers 7 |
| System Certification | D.M. 37/2008 Compliance | Required for entrepreneurial and new rentals 4 |

For properties managed in an entrepreneurial form—defined as those where the owner manages more than four units or opts for professional status—the requirements are even more stringent. These units must possess certifications for all electrical, heating, and cooling systems, as prescribed by D.M. 37/2008. The failure to maintain these standards can lead to the immediate revocation of the CIN and administrative fines reaching €6,000 per violation.1

## **Fiscal Architectures: The Evolution of Cedolare Secca and Entrepreneurial Presumption**

The taxation of short-term rentals in Italy has shifted from a uniform incentive model to a tiered system designed to differentiate between occasional hosts and professional property managers. The primary mechanism remains the *cedolare secca*, an optional flat-rate tax that replaces the progressive IRPEF rates, regional surcharges, and municipal additions.2

### **The 21% vs. 26% Differential**

Starting in the 2024 tax year and solidified in the 2025 Budget Law, the *cedolare secca* rate is no longer fixed at 21% for all properties. Instead, the 21% rate is reserved for a single property per tax year, chosen by the taxpayer. For all other properties managed as short-term rentals (up to the fourth unit), the rate increases to 26%.2 This policy reflects the government's intent to capture a larger share of revenue from individuals building significant rental portfolios without formally transitioning into a corporate structure.

| Number of Properties | Tax Rate (Cedolare Secca) | Administrative Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1st Unit | 21% | Non-Entrepreneurial 2 |
| 2nd to 4th Units | 26% | Non-Entrepreneurial 2 |
| 5th Unit and Above | Ordinary IRPEF / IRES | Mandatory Entrepreneurial (P.IVA) 2 |

If a property owner manages five or more apartments as short-term rentals, the law imposes an "absolute presumption of entrepreneurship." At this threshold, the owner can no longer benefit from the *cedolare secca*. Instead, they must open a *Partita IVA* (VAT number), register with the Chamber of Commerce, and pay social security contributions to INPS.2 For premium investors, this threshold is a critical decision point. While the entrepreneurial route involves higher administrative complexity and the loss of the flat tax, it allows for the deduction of operational costs—such as management fees, utilities, and maintenance—which are not deductible under the *cedolare secca*.2

### **Platform Obligations and Withholding Tax**

The fiscal landscape is further complicated by the role of intermediaries. Digital platforms are now required to act as withholding agents (*sostituti d'imposta*). When a platform handles the payment, it must withhold 21% of the gross rental income and remit it to the Italian Revenue Agency (*Agenzia delle Entrate*).2 For owners subject to the 26% rate, the remaining 5% must be settled during the annual tax declaration. This system ensures that the state receives a baseline of revenue regardless of whether the owner accurately reports their total income. Furthermore, under the EU’s DAC7 directive, platforms are mandated to share the fiscal and cadastral data of all hosts with national tax authorities, leaving virtually no room for undeclared "gray market" activity.2

## **Regional Jurisdictions: A Deep Dive into Puglia and the Salento Corridor**

Puglia, and specifically the Salento region, represents one of Italy’s most dynamic markets for high-end short-term rentals. However, the region has recently enacted some of the country’s most detailed administrative requirements for tourist rentals through amendments to Regional Law 49/2017.19

### **The Administrative Workflow: CIS, CIR, and the New CIA Obligation**

In Puglia, the transition from the old *Codice Identificativo Struttura* (CIS) to the new regional CIR and national CIN is nearly complete. Every property must be registered on the *Digital Management System* (DMS) Puglia. A pivotal change for 2025 is the requirement for even non-entrepreneurial hosts to file a *Comunicazione di Inizio Attività* (CIA) through the municipal SUAP (One-Stop Shop for Productive Activities) portal.20 For properties already in operation before September 30, 2025, owners have 365 days to regularize their position by filing the CIA or SCIA.21

The distinction between the two filings is based on the scale and nature of the activity. The CIA is intended for private individuals renting up to four units without additional "hotel-like" services. The SCIA is required for entrepreneurial activities, which Puglia defines as managing more than four units or offering services beyond the standard provision of linen and cleaning at the change of guests.20

### **Mandatory Insurance and Operational Constraints**

Puglia is unique in its requirement for mandatory civil liability (RC) insurance for all short-term rentals. This policy must protect guests against any risks arising during their stay and must be "commensurate with the receptive capacity" of the property.19 For a premium property, this typically means a policy with significant coverage limits to match the value of the asset and the expectations of a high-end clientele.

Furthermore, Puglia maintains a strict separation between "tourist rentals" (*locazioni turistiche*) and "extra-hotel structures" (*strutture extralberghiere*). A pure tourist rental is legally prohibited from providing services like breakfast, airport transfers, or daily cleaning. If an investor wishes to offer these premium amenities, they must register as a *Casa e Appartamenti per Vacanze* (CAV) or a B\&B, which triggers more rigorous commercial regulations, including higher safety standards and different urban planning requirements.3

### **Municipal Dynamics in Salento: Tourist Taxes and Reporting**

Operators in the Salento region must also navigate municipal ordinances regarding the *imposta di soggiorno* (tourist tax). These taxes are typically seasonal and vary by property classification and municipality.24

| Municipality | STR Tax Rate (High Season) | Period of Application | Duration Cap |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Lecce | €2.00 / night | May 1 – Oct 31 | Max 7 nights 25 |
| Gallipoli | €1.00 / night | Apr 1 – Oct 31 | Max 7 nights 25 |
| Otranto | €1.00 / night | Apr 1 – Sept 30 | Max 7 nights 25 |
| Nardò | €0.60 / night | May 1 – Sept 30 | Max 8 nights 24 |
| Ugento | €1.50 / night | Seasonal | Max 7 nights 25 |

Beyond tax collection, Puglia requires monthly reporting of arrivals and departures through the *Sistema Puglia per l'Osservatorio Turistico* (SPOT). Failure to communicate these statistics, even for months with zero occupancy, can result in administrative fines and a negative compliance rating within the DMS, potentially complicating the renewal of identification codes.20

## **Sicily: The 2025 Tourism Reform and Structural Standards**

Sicily has recently undergone a major legislative overhaul with the passage of Regional Law 6/2025, which aims to harmonize the island's diverse tourism offerings under a unified regulatory umbrella. For investors targeting the baroque centers of Noto, Ragusa, or Syracuse (Ortigia), these rules define the legal boundaries of what constitutes a "premium" rental.14

### **Minimum Dimensions and Hygiene Requirements**

The Sicilian framework places a high emphasis on the physical characteristics of the rental unit. To be eligible for a CIR and subsequently a CIN, a residential property must meet the standards of the D.M. July 5, 1975, and specific regional requirements for tourist accommodation.14

| Room / Unit Type | Minimum Surface Area | Additional Requirements |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Studio (1 Person) | 28 sqm | Includes services 14 |
| Studio (2 People) | 38 sqm | Includes services 14 |
| Single Bedroom | 9 sqm | 2.70m height 14 |
| Double Bedroom | 14 sqm | 2.70m height 14 |
| Bathroom Ratio | 1 per 6 guests | Must have potable water 14 |

For every additional bed beyond the base capacity, the room must have an extra 6 square meters of space, up to a maximum of four non-bunk beds per room. Furthermore, properties in Sicily must guarantee "accessibility and visitability" for guests with disabilities, a requirement that often necessitates careful planning during the renovation of historic properties in cities like Ragusa Ibla.28

### **Registration through Turist@t and Compliance Deadlines**

The administrative gateway in Sicily is the *Turist@t* portal, managed by the Regional Tourism Observatory. Once an account is created using SPID, the owner must submit a registration request detailing the property’s capacity and cadastral information. The CIR is typically issued within a few days of the request being validated. As of 2025, properties must also upload an energy performance certificate (APE) and, in some cases, a declaration that the condominium regulations do not prohibit short-term rentals.14 Existing structures have until June 30, 2026, to adapt to the new minimum requirements set by Law 6/2025, making the 2024–2025 period a critical window for renovation and regularization.29

## **Sardinia and Calabria: Digital Governance and Statistical Rigor**

Sardinia and Calabria have adopted highly digitized systems for managing short-term rentals, with a focus on statistical accuracy and public security.

### **Sardinia: The RLO Portal and the IUN Code**

In Sardinia, the regional identifier is the *Identificativo Univoco Numerico* (IUN). As of February 1, 2025, all new requests for occasional rentals must be submitted through the *Registro delle Locazioni Occasionali* (RLO) platform. The regional administration has explicitly stated that requests sent via email or PEC will no longer be processed, signaling a hard shift toward automated digital compliance.31

Once the IUN is assigned, Sardinian owners must use the *SIRED/ROSS 1000* platform to report monthly tourist flows. The island's regulations are particularly precise regarding the definition of a "tourist": guests staying for more than 30 days are considered "long-term" and are excluded from the STR statistical reporting but must have their contracts registered with the Revenue Agency. Sardinian authorities also mandate the reporting of "zero occupancy" months to ensure the database remains current.31

### **Calabria: Albo Comunale and Ross 1000 Integration**

Calabria’s regulatory framework, established by Law 20/2015 and subsequent 2025 updates, requires all STRs to be registered with the *Albo Comunale* (Municipal Registry) of the town where the property is located. For private individuals managing up to three properties, the process is decentralized to the municipal level. However, once a fourth property is added, the owner must utilize the *CalabriaSUAP* portal to file an entrepreneurial SCIA.35

Calabria has also migrated to the *Ross 1000* portal for all statistical communications. Since January 2025, access is strictly limited to users with SPID. The region imposes heavy fines—ranging from €500 to €5,000 per unit—for the failure to display the CIR or CIN in online advertisements, social media posts, or physical signage at the building entrance.35

## **Tuscany and the Rise of Municipal Containment**

Tuscany, and particularly Florence, has become the epicenter of the legal conflict between the growth of short-term rentals and the preservation of urban residential character. The Regional Law 61/2024 granted significant new powers to municipalities with high tourist density.38

### **The Florence "UNESCO" Zone and the TAR Rulings**

Florence attempted to utilize these powers to ban new short-term rentals in its central UNESCO-designated zone. This move was initially contested by associations of property owners and managers, leading to a complex series of rulings from the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) and the Council of State (*Consiglio di Stato*). In early 2025, the Council of State (Sentence n. 2928/2025) reinforced the principle that while municipalities can regulate urban planning, they cannot arbitrarily restrict the fundamental right of private property leasing without a clear, specific national mandate.40

Despite this, Tuscany's Law 61/2024 allows municipalities to set "criteria and limits" based on the ratio of tourist beds to resident population. This means that a premium investor in Tuscany must be aware of potential local quotas. Furthermore, new regulations may require a 5-year authorization that is contingent on the property meeting high-quality standards, including specific requirements for accessibility and "decorum".39

### **The Ban on Self-Check-In Key Boxes**

Another significant trend in Tuscany and other major art cities is the crackdown on self-check-in "key boxes" in public areas. Municipalities like Florence and Bologna are increasingly viewing these boxes as a form of urban blight and a security risk. New local regulations are moving toward mandatory in-person check-ins or the use of smart locks that do not require external physical boxes on street furniture or building facades.7 For a premium rental, this shift actually aligns with higher service expectations, as a personal welcome is often considered a hallmark of luxury hospitality.3

## **The Hybrid Model Strategy: STR and Transitory Integration**

For investors seeking to stabilize cash flow and mitigate the risks of seasonal tourism, the "hybrid" rental model has emerged as a professional standard. This involves toggling between the short-term rental (*locazione breve*) and the transitory rental (*locazione transitoria*).43

### **The Locazione Transitoria (1–18 Months)**

The *locazione transitoria* is designed for tenants who need housing for a specific, documented reason—such as a temporary work assignment, a university course, or a home renovation—for a period ranging from 1 to 18 months. Unlike the STR, these contracts must be written and formally registered with the *Agenzia delle Entrate* if they exceed 30 days.10

| Feature | Short-Term Rental (STR) | Transitory Rental |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Max Duration | 30 days | 18 months 43 |
| Registration | Optional (if \<30 days) | Mandatory (if \>30 days) 44 |
| Proof of Need | Not required | Mandatory (work/study docs) 43 |
| Services | No breakfast/daily cleaning | Utilities usually included 10 |
| CIN Requirement | Mandatory | Mandatory (if tourist purpose) 5 |

The strategic advantage of this model is flexibility. An owner can offer the property as an STR during the high-demand summer months in Salento or Sicily to maximize ADR, and then switch to a 6-month transitory contract for a remote worker or "digital nomad" during the winter.43 This approach not only ensures year-round occupancy but also bypasses some of the municipal "day limits" (e.g., Venice’s 120-day cap) that apply specifically to tourist rentals.12

## **Market Intelligence: Sub-€500k Investment Paradigms**

The Italian real estate market in 2024 and 2025 shows a distinct "southward" shift for value-driven investors. While Milan and Rome remain high-barrier markets, the regions of Puglia, Sicily, and Calabria offer premium assets with entry prices well below €500,000 and gross rental yields that can exceed 10%.47

### **Sicily: The Baroque Triangle and Ortigia**

The province of Ragusa is currently recording some of the highest yields in the country, averaging 11.5% annually. This is driven by the "real estate renaissance" of towns like Modica and Scicli, where independent historic homes can still be purchased for approximately €1,040 per square meter.47 Similarly, Syracuse (specifically the island of Ortigia) remains a blue-chip location with a 10.5% yield, benefiting from a balanced mix of purchase prices and high-demand tourism.47

### **Puglia: Lecce and the Rural "Borghi"**

In Puglia, the city of Lecce remains a centerpiece for investors. A well-renovated 2-3 room apartment in the historic center can generate over €15,000 per year in STR revenue.49 However, the real growth is in the surrounding rural villages like Nardò and Galatina. In these areas, independent homes and even small *trulli* or *masserie* can be found in the €150,000 to €350,000 range, allowing for a premium "experiential" repositioning that appeals to high-spending international tourists.49

### **Calabria: The Undervalued Frontier**

Calabria represents the lowest entry point, with an average regional price of €958 per square meter. The province of Crotone currently leads the region in rental demand, with average rents reaching nearly €11 per square meter.51 For an investor with a €500,000 budget, Calabria offers the possibility of acquiring multiple units or a significant beachfront villa, though the management infrastructure in this region is less developed than in Puglia or Tuscany, often requiring the use of professional property management firms.34

## **Enforcement, Surveillance, and the "Ghost Host" Operations**

The years 2024 and 2025 have seen a dramatic escalation in enforcement actions by the *Guardia di Finanza* (GdF) and the *Carabinieri NAS*. The implementation of the CIN and the BDSR has provided these authorities with an interoperable data set that makes it nearly impossible for properties to remain "invisible".15

### **Operation "Ghost Host" and Tax Audits**

In 2025, the GdF launched a series of "Ghost Host" operations across major tourist districts, including the Alto Garda and the Rimini coast. These operations used software to cross-reference OTA bookings with bank transfers and tax filings, discovering over €1 million in undeclared income in just the first quarter of 2025\.52 Furthermore, a significant investigation into Airbnb Ireland resulted in a settlement of over €770 million, focusing on the platform's failure to act as a withholding agent for Italian hosts.11

### **NAS Inspections and Safety Violations**

The *Carabinieri NAS* have focused their efforts on the physical safety and hygiene of rental units. In a series of 2024–2025 "sweeps," they inspected over 1,400 structures in major cities, resulting in dozens of immediate closures and over €500,000 in fines.15 The most frequent violations include:

1. **Missing or Non-Functional Detectors:** Failure to install the mandatory gas and CO sensors.1  
2. **Overcrowding:** Advertising more beds than allowed by the property’s *Certificato di Agibilità*.13  
3. **Failure to Report Guests:** Neglecting the mandatory 24-hour report to the *Alloggiati Web* portal, which is a criminal offense under Article 109 of the TULPS.15

| Violation Category | Enforcement Authority | Typical Penalty Range |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Missing National CIN | Municipal Police / GdF | €800 – €8,000 1 |
| Missing Safety Sensors | Carabinieri NAS | €600 – €6,000 1 |
| Omitted Guest Reporting | Polizia di Stato (Questura) | Arrest / €206 Fine 15 |
| Operating Without SCIA | Municipal SUAP | €5,000 – €15,000 15 |
| Tax Omission (240% rule) | Guardia di Finanza | 240% of tax due 3 |

## **Comprehensive Operational Compliance Checklist for 2025–2026**

For a premium short-term rental operation, compliance must be viewed as an ongoing process rather than a one-time setup. The following checklist synthesizes the multi-level requirements into a chronological workflow.

### **Phase 1: Pre-Acquisition and Structural Audit**

* \[ \] **Cadastral Verification:** Ensure the property is in a residential category (A/1 through A/11, excluding A/10).  
* \[ \] **Structural Minimums:** Verify Sicily's 28/38 sqm rules or D.M. 1975 heights (2.70m).  
* \[ \] **Condominium Check:** Review the building’s *Regolamento di Condominio* for any bans on STRs or extra-hotel activities.  
* \[ \] **Safety Planning:** Map the placement of CO/gas detectors and fire extinguishers (1 per floor/200 sqm).

### **Phase 2: Administrative Onboarding**

* \[ \] **Regional Registration:** Obtain the CIR/CIS/IUN from the relevant regional portal (DMS Puglia, Turist@t Sicily, RLO Sardinia).  
* \[ \] **CIA/SCIA Filing:** Submit the notice of activity to the municipal SUAP portal. Mandatory for all in Puglia/Sicily by late 2025\.  
* \[ \] **CIN Generation:** Register on the BDSR portal using SPID/CIE to obtain the national code. Self-certify safety compliance during this step.  
* \[ \] **Questura Credentials:** Secure access to the *Alloggiati Web* system for police reporting.  
* \[ \] **SPOT/Ross 1000 Setup:** Ensure access to the regional statistical reporting platform.

### **Phase 3: Operational Launch and Marketing**

* \[ \] **Display Obligations:** Install the physical plaque with the CIN outside the property. Ensure the CIN is visible in all digital advertisements (watermarking on photos is recommended for 2026).  
* \[ \] **Insurance:** Stipulate the mandatory RC policy (essential for Puglia compliance).  
* \[ \] **Tourist Tax Registration:** Register with the municipal finance office for the collection and remittance of the *imposta di soggiorno*.  
* \[ \] **Smart Access:** If using digital locks, ensure they do not require external "key boxes" on public street furniture if the municipality (like Florence or Bologna) has banned them.

### **Phase 4: Perpetual Compliance Management**

* \[ \] **24-Hour Police Reports:** Daily upload of guest IDs to the Questura.  
* \[ \] **Monthly Statistical Returns:** Accurate reporting of nights stayed, including "zero" months, to SPOT or Ross 1000\.  
* \[ \] **Fiscal Documentation:** Ensure the first property is taxed at 21% and subsequent units at 26% in the annual tax return, citing the CIN for each.  
* \[ \] **Equipment Maintenance:** Certified bi-annual checks of fire extinguishers and sensor battery/functionality.

The Italian short-term rental market is no longer a haven for the "casual" host. The convergence of digital tracking (CIN/BDSR), aggressive fiscal enforcement (DAC7/Ghost Host), and strict safety mandates has created a professionalized ecosystem. For the investor in Puglia, Sicily, or Sardinia, success in this environment is predicated on a commitment to total compliance. While the initial administrative and structural setup is complex, the resulting "cleansing" of the market from irregular competitors and the high demand for premium, safe, and legal accommodations will likely reward professional operators with superior long-term yields and asset appreciation.
